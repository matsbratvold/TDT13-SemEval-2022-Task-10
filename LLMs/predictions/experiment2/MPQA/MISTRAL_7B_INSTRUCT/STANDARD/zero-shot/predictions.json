The international community and even US western allies , including US neighbor Canada , have consistently opposed the plan . Despite the opposition , Bush went it alone . One of the main US diplomatic goals for this year is to persuade the international community to accept the NMD and Russia to agree to revise the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty [ AMD ] by flashing a carrot on a stick . At one time , he said the new US missile defense system would not pose a threat to the international security and would not trigger an arms race ; on another occasion , he stated the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed by the Soviet Union and the United States in 1972 was \" a product of the Cold War era , \" and thus has lost its binding force . He even claimed that to develop the NMD , the United States would be even prepared to scrap the ABM . Over the past year , Bush increased funds for research and testing for the N ! MD and accelerated the test frequency of the anti-missile system . Even after the adoption of the resolution on \" maintaining and abiding by the \" Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty \" on 29 November at the 56th United Nations General Assembly , the United States still persisted in carrying out a fifth missile interception test . In a word , the US development of the NMD is for the purpose of \" attacking other countries and at the same time preventing other countries from attacking it , \" thereby genuinely securing its status of being the \" sole super power . \"",

The responsibility for the event , in which a Chinese plane crashed and a Chinese pilot perished , lies completely with the US side . The US side not only refused to apologize to China but also claimed that \" US crew members were detained by the Chinese side . \" It was only because of it being deterred by the Chinese Government 's firm position and due to the fact that the US crew members were still in China that the United States was compelled to offer an apology . But after the Chinese side released all the US crew members , major US political figures changed their stance immediately and threatened to use human rights , trade , and Olympics hosting issues to \" retaliate \" against China .",

Bush stressed that the war is not only the \" US war \" but also a \" world war . \" The United States views itself as a \" major force of anti-terrorism , \" for in the world only the United States has the capability to carry out the global war against terrorism . Bush said , \" Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists \" and \" any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime . \" The United States wants all the countries in the world to stand behind it in the fight against terrorism and decides which country is its enemy or friend on the basis of that country 's attitude toward it . It is in fact like using multilateral diplomacy to enhance US unilateralism . But the United States obviously practices pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan -- a frontline state in the fight against Pakistan . Before the 11 September event , the United States kept its distance from Pakistan and imposed sanctions on it . But after declaring a war against terrorism the United States not only drew Pakistan to its side but also provided aid to it . Whether the United States will continue to treat Pakistan in a responsible manner , it is anybody 's guess .",

It 's hard enough for her to make good decisions when she 's surrounded by support . It 's even harder when she is n't . Big Sisters helps fill that void by matching caring , responsible adult volunteers with at - risk girls , ages 8 - 14 . A Big Sister is a mentor , a friend and a role model , helping a young girl to develop the self - confidence and life skills necessary to become a responsible , productive and successful adult . Your $ 1,000 contribution can put a mentor in a child 's life - and hope in a child 's future . The results of an 18 - month study completed by Public / Private Ventures showed that children participating in one - to - one Big Sister and Big Brother matches for just one year , reduced first time drug use by 46 % ; lowered school absenteeism by 52 % ; cut aggressive behavior by 33 % ; enhanced school performance ; and improved relations with family and friends . This is positive proof that Big Sisters one - to - one mentoring program helps change lives . Today , we are offering you the opportunity to help change a life . By contributing $ 1,000 you can support one match for one year . This money maintains the infrastructure that fosters and supports the development of effective relationships . This includes a volunteer screening process , orientation , training and ongoing supervision and support by a professional staff . As a Matchmaker you will receive a description of \" your match \" and be identified as a Matchmaker on a plaque in the Big Sisters office , in the agency newsletter and annual report . Today Big Sisters serves over 1,000 girls in central Indiana . But for each girl served , more are left unserved . Over 235 girls are currently waiting for a Big Sister . Imagine the difference the community could make if each congregation pledged its support of one Big Sisters match ! I encourage you to Join me in presenting this matchmaker challenge to your congregation . Sincerely , Dr. Linda McCoy Pastor , THE GARDEN A Blossom of St. Luke 's United Methodist Church",

                        "[ Caracas El Nacional ( Internet version ) in Spanish on 7 February carries a related 760 - word item that says that some opposition deputies agreed that the government 's tactless actions are to blame for the concerns voiced by US Foreign Secretary Colin Powell . The report cites Convergence Deputy Alejandro Arzola saying that Powell 's position clearly reflects the concern that exists in the international community and Latin America over the Venezuelan situation : the atmosphere of conflict and the threats against freedom of expression , democracy , and legal security . Arzola stated : \" The government 's positions are not only harming the country at the domestic level , but also at the international level because thousands of investors are watching on their television sets what is happening in Venezuela , where the rule of law is under fire . \" Arzola added : Any recommendation by a country friendly to Venezuela , especially a country that is Venezuela 's No.1 trade partner , must be heeded , as well as recommendations by the Church and the nation , which is demanding a rectification . The report also cites Democratic Action leader Claudio Fermin , who warned : \" When Chavez came to the Presidency , the United States was buying 1.75 million barrels a day . At present , because of the misguided policy of cutting production , we are only selling them 1.1 million barrels . If to this , we add the President 's constant aggressive attitude and readiness to establish ties between Venezuela and parasitic economies that give us nothing , but fulfill his political commitments , we will very likely continue to lose our edge in the US market . \" According to Fermin , the chief of state still does not understand that if there is no confidence , there will be no investments .

Some of the participants took the line that this is an extremely useful for Russia , which has \" hot air \" ( that is , it is 30 percent short of the permitted level of CO2 emissions ) , and the country can become the dominant seller in the market ; consequently , it has a greater stake than anyone in the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol .

This approach is based on the fact that Russia 's emissions today are almost 25 percent lower than in 1990 , and , according to forecasts , the baseline level will not be reached in the next 10 years . This is substantiated in detail in the RF Energy Strategy Until 2020 , which the government has adopted . Within the framework of the protocol our country must maintain records of , and monitor , emissions and emission quotas , as well as regulate quotas . This requires creating a national system of inventorying emissions and establishing a special registration center to maintain records of quotas . Despite the outward complexity of the task , the creation of a record - keeping and monitoring system is neither very complicated nor very expensive , since the Goskomstat [ State Statistical Committee ] reporting forms that enterprises fill out contain virtually complete data .",

Why do n't I have the sense that the models explain everything ? The problem is that the present stage of study of small climatic models has scientists studying the life of the models as the life of a real climatic system . But to what extent does this reflect real life ? Nevertheless , the progress in gaining knowledge has been tremendous . Our institute , along with the Institute of Systems Analysis and the Russian Academy of Sciences Computer Center , has begun studying the role of climate change in individual regions of Russia in order to forecast economic development . There are no results to speak of yet , but it is important that this area of inquiry has appeared .",

As a result , the temperature does n't change much in the equatorial and middle latitudes but changes a great deal in the polar regions . What does this lead to ? Dispersion is less active , and so - called obstruction or stagnant situation manifest themselves in the atmosphere more and more often . We have just observed such a case of a very lengthy thaw in the center of Russia . Incidentally , last year 's incredibly cold winter in Primorskiy Kray was very possibly an example of the same property . Because , strange as it may seem , prolonged , stagnant cold spells are also a result of global warming when there is less ventilation of the atmosphere as a whole .",

Every year we seek companies , organizations and individuals to sponsor one or more of our families . These families are participants in our community - based programs . These programs focus on keeping the family together by providing counseling and other services to the entire family . After our caseworkers meet with these families and their children they often find they lack even the basic necessities such as cooking utensils , beds , cleaning supplies , etc . We meet these needs immediately . But , the holiday season is a particularly difficult time for these families . They do not have the resources necessary to purchase gifts or food for a holiday meal . We are asking you to consider sponsoring one of our families for this holiday season . If you are interested and would like more information , please contact Lisa Lusk or Marcia Whited at 693-9222 . We would like to have families matched with sponsors non later than xxxx . Thank you for considering this opportunity to make this a memorable holiday season for a family in need . Sincerely ,",

Eventually , 768 aliens were arrested as \" special interest \" detainees . Some ( such as Zacarias Moussaoui ) were actually in INS custody before 9/11 ; most were arrested after . Attorney General John Ashcroft told us that he saw his job in directing this effort as \" risk minimization , \" both to find out who had committed the attacks and to prevent a subsequent attack . Ashcroft ordered all special interest immigration hearings closed to the public , family members , and press ; directed government attorneys to seek denial of bond until such time as they were \" cleared \" of terrorist connections by the FBI and other agencies ; and ordered the identity of the detainees kept secret . INS attorneys charged with prosecuting the immigration violations had trouble getting information about the detainees and any terrorist connections ; in the chaos after the attacks , it was very difficult to reach law enforcement officials , who were following up on other leads . The clearance process approved by the Justice Department was time - consuming , lasting an average of about 80 days ."

Less than one week after September 11 , an early version of what was to become the Patriot Act ( officially , the USA PATRIOT Act ) began to take shape . A central provision of the proposal was the removal of \" the wall \" on information sharing between the intelligence and law enforcement communities ( discussed in chapter 3 ) . Ashcroft told us he was determined to take every conceivable action , within the limits of the Constitution , to identify potential terrorists and deter additional attacks . The administration developed a proposal that eventually passed both houses of Congress by large majorities and was signed into law on October 26 .",

Writing to Rumsfeld on September 17 in a memo headlined \" Preventing More Events , \" he argued that if there was even a 10 percent chance that Saddam Hussein was behind the 9/11 attack , maximum priority should be placed on eliminating that threat . Wolfowitz contended that the odds were \" far more \" than 1 in 10 , citing Saddam 's praise for the attack , his long record of involvement in terrorism , and theories that Ramzi Yousef was an Iraqi agent and Iraq was behind the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center . The next day , Wolfowitz renewed the argument , writing to Rumsfeld about the interest of Yousef 's co-conspirator in the 1995 Manila air plot in crashing an explosives - laden plane into CIA headquarters , and about information from a foreign government regarding Iraqis ' involvement in the attempted hijacking of a Gulf Air flight . Given this background , he wondered why so little thought had been devoted to the danger of suicide pilots , seeing a \" failure of imagination \" and a mind - set that dismissed possibilities .",

This occurred in the weeks following 9/11 , aided by overwhelming international sympathy for the United States . In Phase Two , air strikes and Special Operations attacks would hit key al Qaeda and Taliban targets . In an innovative joint effort , CIA and Special Operations forces would be deployed to work together with each major Afghan faction opposed to the Taliban . The Phase Two strikes and raids began on October 7 . The basing arrangements contemplated for Phase One were substantially secured - after arduous effort - by the end of that month . In Phase Three , the United States would carry out \" decisive operations \" using all elements of national power , including ground troops , to topple the Taliban regime and eliminate al Qaeda 's sanctuary in Afghanistan . Mazar - e - Sharif , in northern Afghanistan , fell to a coalition assault by Afghan and U.S. forces on November 9 . Four days later the Taliban had fled from Kabul . By early December , all major cities had fallen to the coalition . On December 22 , Hamid Karzai , a Pashtun leader from Kandahar , was installed as the chairman of Afghanistan 's interim administration . Afghanistan had been liberated from the rule of the Taliban .",

Health authorities said yesterday that more than 27 people had tested positive for the severe sputum smear type of tuberculosis . A TB expert , Dr Joel Kangangi , said one person infected with the bacteria could spread it to more than 10 people in a day . The doctor , however , said no deaths had been reported . The worst affected areas are Dallas , Majengo and the Shauri Yako slums with a population of 17,000 people . Dr Kangangi , an assistant director of medical services attached to the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Programme , said 56 per cent of those infected with TB were also HIV - positive . Health personnel have been deployed to the affected areas to carry out random screening of residents to contain the outbreak . Yesterday , Dr Kangangi carried out random checks on hundreds of residents in Dallas estate . He was accompanied by the Embu Medical Officer of Health , Dr Nicholas Muraguri , and a team of health personnel . The medic blamed the outbreak on congestion in the slums and failure to observe basic hygienic practices . The residents are being advised to ensure that their houses were well ventilated to avoid multiplication of germs . They are also being advised to seek medical attention immediately they detect symptoms of the disease . The symptoms include prolonged cough , chest pains , fever and loss of weight and appetite .",

        "text": "Tehran , April 13 , IRNA -- Police in Iran have recently seized 824 kilos of illegal drugs , mostly opium , during a series of operations in which three smugglers were killed and 18 others injured , police officials said Saturday . The biggest seizure , amounting to 697 kilos , was made in the city of Iranshahr in the Sistan Baluchestan province , where four fire arms were also confiscated . The rest of the hauls were made in the provinces of southern Fars and southeastern Khorasan . Meanwhile , a police head said Saturday that some 877 kilos of narcotics had been seized in the south of the Tehran province in the last Iranian year which ended on March 20 , 2001 . The bulk of the seizures was opium , weighing 534 kilos , besides 118 kilos of hashish plus other drug assortments . Police dismantled 72 gangs of drug traffickers in the period and arrested 12,910 people on drug - related offenses . An official in the southeastern city of Kerman said Saturday that police in the Kerman province had seized 100 kilos of morphine from drug traffickers in recent days . Iran accounts for 80 percent of the opium and 90 percent of the morphine intercepted in the world , according to the International Narcotics Control Board . The Islamic Republic has launched a relentless anti-drug campaign since the 1979 Islamic Revolution , in which more than 3,100 policemen have lost their lives . Iran 's anti-drug campaign costs the country 800 million dollars per year , according to officials . An official said recently that the Iranian police had seized 112 tons of illegal drugs and arrested 306,000 people on drug - related charges during last Iranian year which ended on March 21 , 2001 .",

Federal , state and local governments are freezing or withdrawing much - needed funding sources for people who are truly in need . In spite of that , Pleasant Run Children 's Homes , with the help of hundreds of volunteers and others who really care , continues to make a significant impact on the futures of families and kids in need of help . We all hear about today 's increases in neglect , abuse and abandonment of those who ca n't fight back : children . Yet few of us hear enough about kids who live through these adversities and do make the grade . The positive side . These are special children . They come into a Pleasant Run program ... whether it 's for therapeutic help in their own homes ( which nurtures whole families ) , through foster care families or in the familial surroundings of our residential homes . For some , it 's a matter of weeks or months ; for others , it 's years . They leave Pleasant Run , generally , ready and able to contribute to society . We 're proud of our children and all that they overcome . We are a not - for - profit , multi - service agency . We would n't exist if the need were n't there . The numbers of children who deserve our services are rising ... as quickly as our programs can grow to serve them . Please help us help them . Pleasant Run Children 's Homes ... \" where good kids get better . \" Sincerely , Mary Roth Tom Hirschauer",

I often wonder when a really great fictional book will be written about this era ( probably decades and decades hence as it is too close ) . In any case , there certainly is no lack of information available about the moguls of technology now as they all become our current pop icons .

That 's ironic , since I think it was just that insularity that helped them , much in the same way that AOL has benefited from being in the Virginia suburbs rather than in Silicon Valley . AOL would never have existed if it had been founded here , I am sure , since its employees would have been mocked into obscurity by the digerati .

Russian First Deputy Fuel and Energy Minister Ivan Matlashov made this announcement during a bilateral roundtable discussion coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the USSR - Iraq Friendship and Cooperation Treaty . Russian companies will have exported 118.6 million barrels of oil from Iraq during the six - month phase ending on May 29 , Matlashov said . During the 10th phase , lasting between June and November 2001 , Russian companies sold 115.3 million barrels . Russian companies will have sold around 1 billion barrels of Iraqi crude for approximately $ 15 billion during all 11 phases stipulated in the 1996 Iraq - UN memorandum . This accounts for roughly 40 % of Iraq 's total oil exports , he said . In April , the UN Sanctions Committee will probably lift restrictions from Russia - Iraq contracts in different spheres valued at about $ 900 million . The United Nations has allowed the implementation of contracts worth some $ 200 million . Of this , Russia 's Zarubezhneft foreign trade organization secured 45 contracts valued at about $ 140 million . Zarubezhneft has shipped $ 45 million worth of equipment and materials in keeping with 33 contracts . The Iraqi side has pledged to \" take into consideration the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry 's recommendations \" related to allocation of oil export quotas to its Russian partners .",
