    "text": "really nice hotel , well laid out all rooms over look the pool. rooms are nice and large have tea coffee making facilties , mini fridge. loads of sunbeds not sure if it would be the same during school holidays. beach is clean they come round collecting plastic drink cups and empty water bottles.went to all four restaurants Asian being how favourite.used the spa which was excellent had the best back massage ever.staff so kind and friendly. you do get some aircraft noise with being so close to airport but not a big problem. choice of drinks are limited but you always find something to drink lovely cocktails. our ages 22 to 50 please go you will like it .",
