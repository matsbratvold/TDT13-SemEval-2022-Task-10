    "text": "Within about two months of the start of combat operations , several hundred CIA operatives and Special Forces soldiers , backed by the striking power of U.S. aircraft and a much larger infrastructure of intelligence and support efforts , had combined with Afghan militias and a small number of other coalition soldiers to destroy the Taliban regime and disrupt al Qaeda . They had killed or captured about a quarter of the enemy 's known leaders . Mohammed Atef , al Qaeda 's military commander and a principal figure in the 9/11 plot , had been killed by a U.S. air strike . According to a senior CIA officer who helped devise the overall strategy , the CIA provided intelligence , experience , cash , covert action capabilities , and entr\u00c3\u00af\u00c2 \u00bf\u00c2\u00bde to tribal allies . In turn , the U.S. military offered combat expertise , firepower , logistics , and communications .",
