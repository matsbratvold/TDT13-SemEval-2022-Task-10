    "text": "The State Department proposed delivering an ultimatum to the Taliban : produce Bin Ladin and his deputies and shut down al Qaeda camps within 24 to 48 hours , or the United States will use all necessary means to destroy the terrorist infrastructure . The State Department did not expect the Taliban to comply . Therefore , State and Defense would plan to build an international coalition to go into Afghanistan . Both departments would consult with NATO and other allies and request intelligence , basing , and other support from countries , according to their capabilities and resources . Finally , the plan detailed a public U.S. stance : America would use all its resources to eliminate terrorism as a threat , punish those responsible for the 9/11 attacks , hold states and other actors responsible for providing sanctuary to terrorists , work with a coalition to eliminate terrorist groups and networks , and avoid malice toward any people , religion , or culture .",
