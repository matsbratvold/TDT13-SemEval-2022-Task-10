    "text": "Think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we never add to stories . Most often reporters recount these tales with each other and with their sources rather than share them with the general public . Much of it , of course , using the standards of top newspapers , cannot be used since it is largely gossip we are repeating , although it certainly could make for some very good stories . I often wonder when a really great fictional book will be written about this era ( probably decades and decades hence as it is too close ) . In any case , there certainly is no lack of information available about the moguls of technology now as they all become our current pop icons . I would posit that Bill and Michael and Steve and Jerry have become the Madonnas of the current age of stock market mania and celebration of the entrepreneur .",
