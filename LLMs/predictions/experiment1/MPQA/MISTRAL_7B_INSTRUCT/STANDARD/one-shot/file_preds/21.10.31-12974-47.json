    "text": "During a general warming , completely opposite phenomena take place . In the polar regions , climate changes are more pronounced than in the middle latitudes . As a result , the temperature does n't change much in the equatorial and middle latitudes but changes a great deal in the polar regions . What does this lead to ? Dispersion is less active , and so - called obstruction or stagnant situation manifest themselves in the atmosphere more and more often . We have just observed such a case of a very lengthy thaw in the center of Russia . Incidentally , last year 's incredibly cold winter in Primorskiy Kray was very possibly an example of the same property . Because , strange as it may seem , prolonged , stagnant cold spells are also a result of global warming when there is less ventilation of the atmosphere as a whole .",
