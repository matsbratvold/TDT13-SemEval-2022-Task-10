    "text": "Responding to a presidential tasking , Clarke 's office sent a memo to Rice on September 18 , titled \" Survey of Intelligence Information on Any Iraq Involvement in the September 11 Attacks . \" Rice 's chief staffer on Afghanistan , Zalmay Khalilzad , concurred in its conclusion that only some anecdotal evidence linked Iraq to al Qaeda . The memo found no \" compelling case \" that Iraq had either planned or perpetrated the attacks . It passed along a few foreign intelligence reports , including the Czech report alleging an April 2001 Prague meeting between Atta and an Iraqi intelligence officer ( discussed in chapter 7 ) and a Polish report that personnel at the headquarters of Iraqi intelligence in Baghdad were told before September 11 to go on the streets to gauge crowd reaction to an unspecified event . Arguing that the case for links between Iraq and al Qaeda was weak , the memo pointed out that Bin Ladin resented the secularism of Saddam Hussein 's regime . Finally , the memo said , there was no confirmed reporting on Saddam cooperating with Bin Ladin on unconventional weapons .",
