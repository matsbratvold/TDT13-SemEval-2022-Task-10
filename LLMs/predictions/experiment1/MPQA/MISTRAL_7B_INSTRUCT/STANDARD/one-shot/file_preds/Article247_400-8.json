    "text": "Give the NYT credit for getting Mother Teresa back on the front page and a bonus point for including some criticism of her in the story . \" Not everyone in Calcutta , or India for that matter , is unanimous in praising the nun , whose organization was able to raise millions of dollars worldwide but made virtually no significant changes in the social structure of this collapsing city 's poor neighborhoods . Salvation -- hers and that of the destitute she rescued from the gutters -- was her aim , not economic or social development as many others understand it , she said . \" It 's odd , however , that in repeating this charge , the Times did n't interview the man most closely associated with it , Christopher Hitchens , or refer to the book where he set it out , The Missionary Position . Hmmm , wanna bet there was a copy of the book on somebody 's desk at the Times though ?",
