Thinking of building a Great Wall of China in the Middle East , replete with elaborate fences and tunnels , is conceding that Israel is not safe , not a normal country . It can not integrate itself into the region , it is an alien seedling and , thus , it is better to isolate and fortify itself as a lowly outpost .",
