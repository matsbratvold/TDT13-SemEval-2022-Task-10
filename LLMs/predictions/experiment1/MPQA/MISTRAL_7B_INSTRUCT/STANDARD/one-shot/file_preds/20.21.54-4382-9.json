    "text": "This report [ above - mentioned document by China ] should be an eye opener for the whole world and the United States should be viewed in its true perspective . Pakistan also needs to rethink in this regard . The way in which Pakistan has been fully supporting the United States after 11 September 2001 - - the total benefit of that has been earned by the United States . Pakistan has not only earned a bad name but also its internal and external problems have increased manifold . Pakistan should draw its own conclusions in the light of its own circumstances , from this report issued by China . Instead of blindly accepting every demand made by the United States and responding positively to every American phone call , Pakistan should take every single step carefully .",
