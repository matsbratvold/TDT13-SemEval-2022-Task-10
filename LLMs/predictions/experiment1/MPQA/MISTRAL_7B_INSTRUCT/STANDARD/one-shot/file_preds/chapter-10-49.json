    "text": "\" PHASE TWO \" AND THE QUESTION OF IRAQ President Bush had wondered immediately after the attack whether Saddam Hussein 's regime might have had a hand in it . Iraq had been an enemy of the United States for 11 years , and was the only place in the world where the United States was engaged in ongoing combat operations . As a former pilot , the President was struck by the apparent sophistication of the operation and some of the piloting , especially Hanjour 's high - speed dive into the Pentagon . He told us he recalled Iraqi support for Palestinian suicide terrorists as well . Speculating about other possible states that could be involved , the President told us he also thought about Iran .",
