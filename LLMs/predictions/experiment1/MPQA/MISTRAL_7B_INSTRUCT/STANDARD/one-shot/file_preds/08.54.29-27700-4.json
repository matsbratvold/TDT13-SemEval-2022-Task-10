    "text": "His two - day removal from office began when he tried to stack the board of the state - owned oil company in his favor . The company 's executives revolted , threatening a cutoff of oil . That was a catalyst for pent - up opposition to Chavez . Business groups and labor unions joined in a giant protest , perhaps knowing that portions of the military were on their side . When gunshots were fired during a march on the presidential palace last Thursday , killing more than a dozen , military leaders forced Chavez to step aside . But then international pressure and renewed domestic support for Chavez forced the generals to let him take office again .",
