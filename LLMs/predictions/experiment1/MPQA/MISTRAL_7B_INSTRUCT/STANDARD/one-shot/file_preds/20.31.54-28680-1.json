    "text": "Once coming to power , Bush insisted on deploying the National Missile Defense System [ NMD ] . The international community and even US western allies , including US neighbor Canada , have consistently opposed the plan . Despite the opposition , Bush went it alone . One of the main US diplomatic goals for this year is to persuade the international community to accept the NMD and Russia to agree to revise the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty [ AMD ] by flashing a carrot on a stick . At one time , he said the new US missile defense system would not pose a threat to the international security and would not trigger an arms race ; on another occasion , he stated the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed by the Soviet Union and the United States in 1972 was \" a product of the Cold War era , \" and thus has lost its binding force . He even claimed that to develop the NMD , the United States would be even prepared to scrap the ABM . Over the past year , Bush increased funds for research and testing for the N ! MD and accelerated the test frequency of the anti-missile system . Even after the adoption of the resolution on \" maintaining and abiding by the \" Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty \" on 29 November at the 56th United Nations General Assembly , the United States still persisted in carrying out a fifth missile interception test . In a word , the US development of the NMD is for the purpose of \" attacking other countries and at the same time preventing other countries from attacking it , \" thereby genuinely securing its status of being the \" sole super power . \"",
