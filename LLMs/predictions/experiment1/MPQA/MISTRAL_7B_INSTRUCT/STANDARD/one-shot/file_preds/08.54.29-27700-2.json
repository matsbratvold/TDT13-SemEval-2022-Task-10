    "text": "President Chavez - a former Army coup - meister himself , who was elected three years ago - has abused his popular mandate with heavy - handed measures based on a Constitution largely rewritten by himself and his supporters . He has sometimes talked of remaining president past the year 2020 . And his economic promises to the poor are in shreds , while his diplomatic flirtation with leftist world dictators only hints at his inclinations to gain more power .",
