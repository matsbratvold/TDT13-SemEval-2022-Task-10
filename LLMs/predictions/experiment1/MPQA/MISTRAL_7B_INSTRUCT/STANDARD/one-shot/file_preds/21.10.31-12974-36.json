The reduction level varies . The US , Japan and members of the EU must reduce emissions by 7 , 6 and 8 percent from the 1990 level . A limitation , rather than reduction , of emissions is specified for several developed countries ( New Zealand , Norway ) , and Australia and Iceland received the right to increase emissions . If a country fails to use up its quota , it can sell the \" surplus . \"",
