He indicated : \" These reports have tried to suggest the existence of ties between Miraflores [ Presidential Palace ] and terrorist groups : There are documents presumably drafted by the FAN [ National Armed Forces ] expressing discontent with the government ; the video disclosed by the journalists ; and [ Justice First Deputy ] Gerardo Blyde 's remarks on the creation of militia groups trained by the guerrillas . All this has sounded the alarm for the US Executive and suits the opposition 's objectives to bring about an intervention or a blockade , which would hurt the people it claims to defend . \"",
