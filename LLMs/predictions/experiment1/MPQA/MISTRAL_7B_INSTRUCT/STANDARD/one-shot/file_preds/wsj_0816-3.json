    "text": "Analysts have complained that third - quarter corporate earnings have n't been very good , but the effect hit home particularly hard yesterday . Compaq Computer nose - dived $ 8.625 a share , to $ 100 , and pulled other technology issues lower after reporting lower - than - expected earnings after the stock market closed Wednesday . Later yesterday the nation 's major auto makers added to the gloom when they each reported their core auto operations were net losers in the third quarter .",
