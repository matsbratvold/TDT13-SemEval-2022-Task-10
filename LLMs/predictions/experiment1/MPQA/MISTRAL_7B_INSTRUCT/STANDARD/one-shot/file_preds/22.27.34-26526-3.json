    "text": "The attacks on targets in Afghanistan that began yesterday [ 7 October ] , remain a risky enterprise . The coming days will reveal whether or not they were effective , were sufficiently precisely targeted and limited in scope . That is a clear condition for this first , unavoidable phase in the battle against terrorism to be humanly acceptable . But they cannot be any real talk of success until the broad strategy against terrorism begins to bear fruit . A strategy that worldwide must include both a degree of repression but most importantly constructive and positive measures .",
