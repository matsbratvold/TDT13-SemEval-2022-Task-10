    "text": "It is due to this hegemony , which the United States wants to maintain , that its State Department makes an assessment of the human rights situation in different countries and prepares a report on their violations all over the world . The United States has never tried to make a self - assessment . After the 11 September events , the United States completely ignored the international convention of human rights and by doing so negated its own constitution . After the events in Washington and New York , approximately 1,000 Pakistanis were thrown into jail , and one person , Mohammed Butt , died of heart failure during detention . No court case was made against the others arrested nor they were given the right to defend themselves . Five hundred Taliban prisoners arrested from Afghanistan are being kept in cages on an island near Cuba . These prisoners have been placed in inhuman conditions and the reason for keeping them on this island is that US law does not apply there . As a lesson to others ! , various American TV channels , daily , show shots of the conditions under which these prisoners are being kept .",
