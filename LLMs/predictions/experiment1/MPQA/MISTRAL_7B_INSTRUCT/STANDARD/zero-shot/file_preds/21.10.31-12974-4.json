    "text": "The first to raise the problem 40 years ago was the Soviet scientist Mikhail Budyko , who saw that the curve on a graph of the air temperature of the earth 's surface stratum was inexorably moving toward the upper right - hand corner . Participants in the debate also proceeded from the postulate that the earth 's atmosphere has been heating up over the past 100 years . It is another matter that the reasons for this alarming phenomenon are not completely clear , and experts offer different interpretations of the consequences of global warming . Rumor has it that the late author of the greenhouse model told Academician Roald Sagdeyev : \" I'm a little uneasy when I tell the Americans about my model , because it suggests that Russia 's agriculture will gain from global warming , while America 's agriculture will lose . \" Sagdeyev looked at Budyko with interest : \" But then where will we buy grain ? \"",
