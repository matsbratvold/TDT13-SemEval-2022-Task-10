In the document , the United States has been very openly told that it has become the number one country in damaging solidarity of other countries and violating human rights there . The Iranian President Mohammed Khatami , on the start of his visit to Austria , protested against this dictatorial move by the United States . He also condemned the statement made by President Bush terming Iran , Iraq and North Korea as ' axis of evil ' and that these countries are preparing weapons of mass destruction .",
