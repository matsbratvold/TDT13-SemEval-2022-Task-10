    "text": "So the shift in the image of Gates has been an interesting one for me to watch . The smart - boy technologist is now being painted as the whiny bully . I personally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of Microsoft on just one man -- at AOL , for example , there was a conscious effort to develop other \" characters , \" for lack of a better word . So there , while you think of Case , you also think of Pittman and Leonsis and increasingly a range of other executives . Steve Ballmer , of course , is now getting a lot more attention at Microsoft , but it still seems to be Bill 's show over there .",
