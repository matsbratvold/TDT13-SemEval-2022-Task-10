    "text": "After a flat second quarter tied largely to lower newsprint earnings , Kimberly - Clark attributed the gain to improved results in its consumer businesses in North America , Brazil and Korea . Those gains came from higher prices , particularly for disposable diapers and tissue products , and from increased sales , primarily for feminine - care products , the company said . Newsprint results continued to be depressed , the company added , because of industrywide price discounting .",
