    "text": "Some terminological refinements came up as well . For example , Prof. Viktor Danilov - Danilyan maintain that \" we must not speak of warming , but of global climatic changes ; warming is merely one aspect of these changes . \" What is cited as the reason for them , the scientist continues , \" is almost always the increase in the greenhouse effect due to a larger concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . This concentration grows , in turn , it is usually written , due to the burning of a huge quantity of organic fuel ( oil , natural gas , coal , wood , peat , etc. ) by industry , transport , agriculture and households . But this is not the only cause of climatic change . It is n't even the only cause of the increase in the greenhouse effect . \"",
