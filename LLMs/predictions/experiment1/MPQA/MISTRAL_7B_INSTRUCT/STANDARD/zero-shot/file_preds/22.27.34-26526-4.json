There is a real danger that the wounded but not yet eliminated network will play its \" trump card \" and commit further acts of terrorism . The economic impact of the 11 September attacks was already disastrous , with clear effects on the world economy , hitting the poorest countries by far the most . The whole operation against terrorism can have positive but also unintentionally negative effects on the international stage . But we had no choice . To have sat back with arms folded would have made us all hostages .",
