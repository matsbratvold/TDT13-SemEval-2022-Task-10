    "text": "PLANNING FOR WAR By late in the evening of September 11 , the President had addressed the nation on the terrible events of the day . Vice President Cheney described the President 's mood as somber . The long day was not yet over . When the larger meeting that included his domestic department heads broke up , President Bush chaired a smaller meeting of top advisers , a group he would later call his \" war council . \" This group usually included Vice President Cheney , Secretary of State Powell , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , General Hugh Shelton , Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs ( later to become chairman ) General Myers , DCI Tenet , Attorney General Ashcroft , and FBI Director Robert Mueller . From the White House staff , National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and Chief of Staff Card were part of the core group , often joined by their deputies , Stephen Hadley and Joshua Bolten . In this restricted National Security Council meeting , the President said it was a time for self - defense . The United States would punish not just the perpetrators of the attacks , but also those who harbored them . Secretary Powell said the United States had to make it clear to Pakistan , Afghanistan , and the Arab states that the time to act was now . He said we would need to build a coalition . The President noted that the attacks provided a great opportunity to engage Russia and China . Secretary Rumsfeld urged the President and the principals to think broadly about who might have harbored the attackers , including Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , Sudan , and Iran . He wondered aloud how much evidence the United States would need in order to deal with these countries , pointing out that major strikes could take up to 60 days to assemble .",
