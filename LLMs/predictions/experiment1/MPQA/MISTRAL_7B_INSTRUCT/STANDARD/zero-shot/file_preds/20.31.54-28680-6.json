    "text": "After the 11 September attacks on the United States , the international community strongly condemned the terrorist acts and expressed sympathy and support to the American people . Supported by the world , the United States launched the \" war against terrorism \" of this century . Bush stressed that the war is not only the \" US war \" but also a \" world war . \" The United States views itself as a \" major force of anti-terrorism , \" for in the world only the United States has the capability to carry out the global war against terrorism . Bush said , \" Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists \" and \" any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime . \" The United States wants all the countries in the world to stand behind it in the fight against terrorism and decides which country is its enemy or friend on the basis of that country 's attitude toward it . It is in fact like using multilateral diplomacy to enhance US unilateralism . But the United States obviously practices pragmatism in its treatment of Pakistan -- a frontline state in the fight against Pakistan . Before the 11 September event , the United States kept its distance from Pakistan and imposed sanctions on it . But after declaring a war against terrorism the United States not only drew Pakistan to its side but also provided aid to it . Whether the United States will continue to treat Pakistan in a responsible manner , it is anybody 's guess .",
