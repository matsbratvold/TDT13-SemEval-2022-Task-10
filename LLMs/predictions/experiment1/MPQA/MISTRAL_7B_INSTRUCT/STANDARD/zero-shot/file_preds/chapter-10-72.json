    "text": "In December 2001 , Afghan forces , with limited U.S. support , engaged al Qaeda elements in a cave complex called Tora Bora . In March 2002 , the largest engagement of the war was fought , in the mountainous Shah - i - Kot area south of Gardez , against a large force of al Qaeda jihadists . The three - week battle was substantially successful , and almost all remaining al Qaeda forces took refuge in Pakistan 's equally mountainous and lightly governed frontier provinces . As of July 2004 , Bin Ladin and Zawahiri are still believed to be at large .",
