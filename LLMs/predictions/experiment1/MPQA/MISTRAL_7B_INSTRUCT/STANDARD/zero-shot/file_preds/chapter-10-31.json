That afternoon , Secretary of State Powell announced at the beginning of an NSC meeting that Pakistani President Musharraf had agreed to every U.S. request for support in the war on terrorism . The next day , the U.S. embassy in Islamabad confirmed that Musharraf and his top military commanders had agreed to all seven demands . \" Pakistan will need full US support as it proceeds with us , \" the embassy noted . \" Musharraf said the GOP [ government of Pakistan ] was making substantial concessions in allowing use of its territory and that he would pay a domestic price . His standing in Pakistan was certain to suffer . To counterbalance that he needed to show that Pakistan was benefiting from his decisions . \"",
