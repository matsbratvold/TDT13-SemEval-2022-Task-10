    "text": "President Bush chaired two more meetings of the NSC on September 12 . In the first meeting , he stressed that the United States was at war with a new and different kind of enemy . The President tasked principals to go beyond their pre-9/11 work and develop a strategy to eliminate terrorists and punish those who support them . As they worked on defining the goals and objectives of the upcoming campaign , they considered a paper that went beyond al Qaeda to propose the \" elimination of terrorism as a threat to our way of life , \" an aim that would include pursuing other international terrorist organizations in the Middle East .",
