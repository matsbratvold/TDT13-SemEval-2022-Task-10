    "text": "Rice chaired a Principals Committee meeting on September 13 in the Situation Room to refine how the fight against al Qaeda would be conducted . The principals agreed that the overall message should be that anyone supporting al Qaeda would risk harm . The United States would need to integrate diplomacy , financial measures , intelligence , and military actions into an overarching strategy . The principals also focused on Pakistan and what it could do to turn the Taliban against al Qaeda . They concluded that if Pakistan decided not to help the United States , it too would be at risk .",
