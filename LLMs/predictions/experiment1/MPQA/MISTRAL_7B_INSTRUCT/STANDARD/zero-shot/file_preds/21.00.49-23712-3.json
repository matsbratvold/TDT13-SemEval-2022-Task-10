A physical border between Israel and a new Palestinian state will be twisted and distorted to accommodate Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza . Unilateral separation without a negotiated agreement could be realized - only if Israel is willing to uproot around 100 settlements . Sharon says flatly he will not withdraw from a single settlement . He thinks that every settlement is important and is determined that Israelis must retain as much land in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as possible .",
