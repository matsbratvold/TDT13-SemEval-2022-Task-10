    "text": "[ Caracas El Nacional ( Internet version ) in Spanish on 7 February carries a related 760 - word item that says that some opposition deputies agreed that the government 's tactless actions are to blame for the concerns voiced by US Foreign Secretary Colin Powell . The report cites Convergence Deputy Alejandro Arzola saying that Powell 's position clearly reflects the concern that exists in the international community and Latin America over the Venezuelan situation : the atmosphere of conflict and the threats against freedom of expression , democracy , and legal security . Arzola stated : \" The government 's positions are not only harming the country at the domestic level , but also at the international level because thousands of investors are watching on their television sets what is happening in Venezuela , where the rule of law is under fire . \" Arzola added : Any recommendation by a country friendly to Venezuela , especially a country that is Venezuela 's No.1 trade partner , must be heeded , as well as recommendations by the Church and the nation , which is demanding a rectification . The report also cites Democratic Action leader Claudio Fermin , who warned : \" When Chavez came to the Presidency , the United States was buying 1.75 million barrels a day . At present , because of the misguided policy of cutting production , we are only selling them 1.1 million barrels . If to this , we add the President 's constant aggressive attitude and readiness to establish ties between Venezuela and parasitic economies that give us nothing , but fulfill his political commitments , we will very likely continue to lose our edge in the US market . \" According to Fermin , the chief of state still does not understand that if there is no confidence , there will be no investments . Movement Toward Socialism Deputy Julio Montoya stated : \" The national government has been extremely incompetent in handling relations with the United States . It has been vague about Venezuela 's intentions regarding the protection of crude prices and the war on terrorism . Ambiguous situations constitute a breeding ground for bilateral tensions and the fact that currently , we do not even have an ambassador in Washington indicates that we are on the verge of a major breakdown in our relations with our leading trade partner . \" ]",
