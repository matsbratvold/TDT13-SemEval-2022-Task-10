    "text": "This \" fait accompli \" in Zimbabwe is a challenge for the international community . It can only rise to meet it by making some radical changes . Indignant protests apart , nothing was done to prevent the disaster awaiting one of the key countries in southern Africa , seen as the continent 's growth pole . The weapon of so - called \" intelligent \" sanctions proved ineffective , especially as the punitive measures were taken too late and only served to deny Robert Mugabe and his associates trips abroad and access to the funds they have spirited away . They amounted to no more than a ban on holidays and a golden retirement . Finally and most importantly , Great Britain remained locked in the familiar psychodrama between the former colonizer and colonized . Africa , with its own \" observers , \" has just ratified a shameful electoral sham . Kenya and Tanzania even \" congratulated \" Robert Mugabe on his re-election after the first round .",
