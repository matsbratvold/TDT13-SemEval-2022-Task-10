    "text": "President Bush also tasked the State Department , which on the following day delivered to the White House a paper titled \" Game Plan for a Political - Military Strategy for Pakistan and Afghanistan . \" The paper took it as a given that Bin Ladin would continue to act against the United States even while under Taliban control . It therefore detailed specific U.S. demands for the Taliban : surrender Bin Ladin and his chief lieutenants , including Ayman al Zawahiri ; tell the United States what the Taliban knew about al Qaeda and its operations ; close all terrorist camps ; free all imprisoned foreigners ; and comply with all UN Security Council resolutions .",
