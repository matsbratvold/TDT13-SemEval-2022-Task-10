It drew on the Infinite Resolve \" phased campaign \" plan the Pentagon had begun developing in November 2000 as an addition to the strike options it had been refining since 1998 . But Shelton added a new element - the possible significant use of ground forces - and that is where President Bush reportedly focused his attention .",
