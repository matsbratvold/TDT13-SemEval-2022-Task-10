They have absurdly criticized as \" inhumane \" the decision to temporarily place prison suits , handcuffs and blindfolds on the terrorists during transfer to protect the military personnel guarding them . They have even demanded upgraded accommodations , seemingly forgetting that these are the leaders of a worldwide terrorist organization who have repeatedly vowed to kill innocent Americans through war or terror .",
