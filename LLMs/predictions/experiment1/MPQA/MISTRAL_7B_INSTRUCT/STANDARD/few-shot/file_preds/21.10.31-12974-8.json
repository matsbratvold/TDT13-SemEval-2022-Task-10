    "text": "The speaker 's ardor was cooled by the well - known Sergey Kapitsa , who is not inclined to give way to rapture over the advantages promised to Russia . He also questions the predicted amount of future warming . Six degrees , the professor believes , is unlikely , since that kind of thing has not happened on the planet in the past 420,000 years . This is indicated by a well drilled in the ice cap of Antarctica 30 years ago , which helps to comprehend what has happened to climate .",
