Tenet described a plan for collecting intelligence and mounting covert operations . He proposed inserting CIA teams into Afghanistan to work with Afghan warlords who would join the fight against al Qaeda . These CIA teams would act jointly with the military 's Special Operations units . President Bush later praised this proposal , saying it had been a turning point in his thinking .",
