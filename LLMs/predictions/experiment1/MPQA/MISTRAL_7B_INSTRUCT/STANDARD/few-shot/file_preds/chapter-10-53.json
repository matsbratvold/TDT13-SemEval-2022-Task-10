    "text": "According to Rice , the issue of what , if anything , to do about Iraq was really engaged at Camp David . Briefing papers on Iraq , along with many others , were in briefing materials for the participants . Rice told us the administration was concerned that Iraq would take advantage of the 9/11 attacks . She recalled that in the first Camp David session chaired by the President , Rumsfeld asked what the administration should do about Iraq . Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz made the case for striking Iraq during \" this round \" of the war on terrorism .",
