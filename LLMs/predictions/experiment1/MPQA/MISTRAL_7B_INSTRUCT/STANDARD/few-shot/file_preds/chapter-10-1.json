    "text": "While the plan at the elementary school had been to return to Washington , by the time Air Force One was airborne at 9:55 A.M. the Secret Service , the President 's advisers , and Vice President Cheney were strongly advising against it . President Bush reluctantly acceded to this advice and , at about 10:10 , Air Force One changed course and began heading due west . The immediate objective was to find a safe location - not too far away - where the President could land and speak to the American people . The Secret Service was also interested in refueling the aircraft and paring down the size of the traveling party . The President 's military aide , an Air Force officer , quickly researched the options and , sometime around 10:20 , identified Barksdale Air Force Base as an appropriate interim destination .",
