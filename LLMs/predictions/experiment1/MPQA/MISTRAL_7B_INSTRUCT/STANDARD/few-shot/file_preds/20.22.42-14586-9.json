    "text": "The deputy said that Powell 's remarks did not surprise him and added that the US official 's opinion is based on reports published by the domestic and international press , which is waging a ruthless war against the Venezuelan chief of state . He noted : \" The opposition is succeeding at portraying an image of Venezuela that scares away investors and triggers domestic turmoil to request the intervention of foreign powers in the country . \" Thus , Carreno excused the White House official , whom - he argued - was misled by the smear campaign and information sabotage that has been unleashed against Chavez in the country and abroad . He took one further step and invited Powell to visit Venezuela to see what is really happening .",
