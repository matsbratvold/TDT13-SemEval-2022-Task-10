    "text": "The LAT focuses on new dissension within the Israeli government about whether or not Israel should continue to maintain forces in southern Lebanon , dissension fueled when an Israeli commando raid there late last week was ambushed , with twelve deaths the result . Perhaps the most striking indicator of a change of mood inside the government reported by the paper is the news that cabinet member Ariel Sharon , who as Defense Minister in 1982 got Israel entrenched in Lebanon in the first place , is among those urging a reconsideration of the deployment .",
