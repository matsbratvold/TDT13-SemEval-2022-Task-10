    "text": "Second , we found no evidence of political intervention . We found no evidence that anyone at the White House above the level of Richard Clarke participated in a decision on the departure of Saudi nationals . The issue came up in one of the many video teleconferences of the interagency group Clarke chaired , and Clarke said he approved of how the FBI was dealing with the matter when it came up for interagency discussion at his level . Clarke told us , \" I asked the FBI , Dale Watson . . . to handle that , to check to see if that was all right with them , to see if they wanted access to any of these people , and to get back to me . And if they had no objections , it would be fine with me . \" Clarke added , \" I have no recollection of clearing it with anybody at the White House . \"",
