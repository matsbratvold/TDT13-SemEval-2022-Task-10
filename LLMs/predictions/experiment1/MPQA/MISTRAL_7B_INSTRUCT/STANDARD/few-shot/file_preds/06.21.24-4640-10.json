    "text": "As I toured Camp X - Ray , I stared into the faces of evil . As I stood just feet away from barbarians who only weeks earlier fired machine guns at American troops , incited bloody prison riots and ambushes and , boasted of plans to kill innocent people , I could not help but feel the grief and anguish of those who lost loved ones on September 11 or during the war in Afghanistan . I have no doubt that , if given the opportunity , any of the detainees would have relished the chance to kill me . Indeed , since their arrival at Camp - X - Ray , some of the terrorists have openly threatened the Marines who guard them and talk anxiously about returning home soon to continue terrorizing the American people .",
