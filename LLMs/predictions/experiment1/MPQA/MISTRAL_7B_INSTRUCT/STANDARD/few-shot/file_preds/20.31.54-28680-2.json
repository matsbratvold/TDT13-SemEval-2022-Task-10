    "text": "The Sino - US plane collision event that occurred on 1 April can best illustrate the US alternate application of the \" two - isms \" in its diplomacy . In the plane collision event , if one goes by the US logic , only the US spy plane is permitted to spy at other people 's doorsteps ; the host , on the other hand , does not even have the right to look after its doors and to protect its yard . The responsibility for the event , in which a Chinese plane crashed and a Chinese pilot perished , lies completely with the US side . The US side not only refused to apologize to China but also claimed that \" US crew members were detained by the Chinese side . \" It was only because of it being deterred by the Chinese Government 's firm position and due to the fact that the US crew members were still in China that the United States was compelled to offer an apology . But after the Chinese side released all the US crew members , major US political figures changed their stance immediately and threatened to use human rights , trade , and Olympics hosting issues to \" retaliate \" against China .",
