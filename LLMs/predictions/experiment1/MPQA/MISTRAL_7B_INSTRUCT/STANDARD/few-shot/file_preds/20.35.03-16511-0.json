The electoral hijacking had been announced , prepared , and organized . It has now taken place . Should one be surprised ? Since he nearly lost his parliamentary majority in June 2000 , the head of state has stated and restated to his supporters that the presidential election was going to be a \" war . \" He was as good as his word .",
