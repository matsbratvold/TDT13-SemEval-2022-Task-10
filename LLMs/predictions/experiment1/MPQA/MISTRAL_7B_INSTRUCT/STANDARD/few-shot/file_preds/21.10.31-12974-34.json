    "text": "In Russia , up to 98 percent of all emissions of the main greenhouse gas -- CO2 -- come from the burning of fossil fuels ( coal , oil , gas ) . This means the problem of reducing emissions is a problem of energy efficiency and energy saving . So far this potential has been utilized only to a small degree , whereas there are almost no such reserves left in the EU countries and Japan . That is why carrying out a project and reducing emissions in Russia is far cheaper than in most developed countries .",
