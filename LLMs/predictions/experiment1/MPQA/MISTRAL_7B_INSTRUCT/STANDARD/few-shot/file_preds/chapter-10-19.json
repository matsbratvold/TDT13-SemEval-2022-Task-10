    "text": "The government 's ability to collect intelligence inside the United States , and the sharing of such information between the intelligence and law enforcement communities , was not a priority before 9/11 . Guidelines on this subject issued in August 2001 by Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson essentially recapitulated prior guidance . However , the attacks of 9/11 changed everything . Less than one week after September 11 , an early version of what was to become the Patriot Act ( officially , the USA PATRIOT Act ) began to take shape . A central provision of the proposal was the removal of \" the wall \" on information sharing between the intelligence and law enforcement communities ( discussed in chapter 3 ) . Ashcroft told us he was determined to take every conceivable action , within the limits of the Constitution , to identify potential terrorists and deter additional attacks . The administration developed a proposal that eventually passed both houses of Congress by large majorities and was signed into law on October 26 .",
