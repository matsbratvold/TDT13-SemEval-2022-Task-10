    "text": "There are several models today , and they answer the question of why the climate is changing with varying degrees of persuasiveness . Why do n't I have the sense that the models explain everything ? The problem is that the present stage of study of small climatic models has scientists studying the life of the models as the life of a real climatic system . But to what extent does this reflect real life ? Nevertheless , the progress in gaining knowledge has been tremendous . Our institute , along with the Institute of Systems Analysis and the Russian Academy of Sciences Computer Center , has begun studying the role of climate change in individual regions of Russia in order to forecast economic development . There are no results to speak of yet , but it is important that this area of inquiry has appeared .",
