    "text": "And now Andrey Gudkov , an expert at the Center for Strategic Studies , follows Budyko in insisting that Russia , as well as Canada and Alaska , gain , since \" lands situated in a condition of permafrost will gradually turn into fertile soils for agricultural production . \" But the rich Russian fields that stretch across the Arctic zone are small comfort to humankind as a whole , so Gudkov proposes blocking off the sun with an umbrella that would be suspended in space . The expert immediately sketched on a blackboard what this should look like , mixing up chemical symbols : rockets would carry metallic sodium into orbits around the earth . Cooling aerosols dispersed over the polar zones would prevent overheating of the tundra during sunny summer nights .",
