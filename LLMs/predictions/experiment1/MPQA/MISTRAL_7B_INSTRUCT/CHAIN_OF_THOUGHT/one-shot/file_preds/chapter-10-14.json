    "text": "The very process of reviewing these issues underscored the absence of an effective government organization dedicated to assessing vulnerabilities and handling problems of protection and preparedness . Though a number of agencies had some part of the task , none had security as its primary mission . By September 14 , Vice President Cheney had decided to recommend , at least as a first step , a new White House entity to coordinate all the relevant agencies rather than tackle the challenge of combining them in a new department . This new White House entity would be a homeland security adviser and Homeland Security Council - paralleling the National Security Council system . Vice President Cheney reviewed the proposal with President Bush and other advisers . President Bush announced the new post and its first occupant - Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge - in his address to a joint session of Congress on September 20 .",
