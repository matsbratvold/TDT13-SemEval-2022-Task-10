    "text": "A total disengagement from the Palestinians , complete with walls and razor wire , might provide Israel its long - desired security and might free it of the burden of trying to control seven million desperate Palestinians , any number of whom are willing to die in order to end the occupation . But separation will not mean an end to the occupation and no Israeli government can provide security as long as it persists in its efforts to maintain its presence beyond Israel 's pre-1967 borders and to retain territories inhabited by millions of Palestinians . By now , it should be clear to everyone that retaliating against every act of Palestinian resistance with Israel 's superior ability to punish Palestinians does not provide the security that Israelis are demanding .",
