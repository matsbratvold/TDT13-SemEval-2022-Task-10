    "text": "In Phase One , the United States and its allies would move forces into the region and arrange to operate from or over neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan and Pakistan . This occurred in the weeks following 9/11 , aided by overwhelming international sympathy for the United States . In Phase Two , air strikes and Special Operations attacks would hit key al Qaeda and Taliban targets . In an innovative joint effort , CIA and Special Operations forces would be deployed to work together with each major Afghan faction opposed to the Taliban . The Phase Two strikes and raids began on October 7 . The basing arrangements contemplated for Phase One were substantially secured - after arduous effort - by the end of that month . In Phase Three , the United States would carry out \" decisive operations \" using all elements of national power , including ground troops , to topple the Taliban regime and eliminate al Qaeda 's sanctuary in Afghanistan . Mazar - e - Sharif , in northern Afghanistan , fell to a coalition assault by Afghan and U.S. forces on November 9 . Four days later the Taliban had fled from Kabul . By early December , all major cities had fallen to the coalition . On December 22 , Hamid Karzai , a Pashtun leader from Kandahar , was installed as the chairman of Afghanistan 's interim administration . Afghanistan had been liberated from the rule of the Taliban .",
