    "text": "At GMAC , net dropped 3.1 % to $ 234.5 million from $ 241.9 million . The finance unit attributed the decline to higher borrowing costs compared with a year earlier . GMAC said its automotive financing and leasing business rose 35 % in the U.S. , largely because of dealer and customer incentives used to boost sales . GMAC profits are combined with earnings from the rest of GM 's operations and attributed to the company 's traditional common stock .",
