It was aimed at reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and assigns countries quotas on their emissions . As of today , more than 80 nations ( all the developed countries and almost all of the CIS countries ) have signed the Kyoto Protocol , and almost 40 have ratified it . Russia signed the document three years ago , in March 1999 .",
