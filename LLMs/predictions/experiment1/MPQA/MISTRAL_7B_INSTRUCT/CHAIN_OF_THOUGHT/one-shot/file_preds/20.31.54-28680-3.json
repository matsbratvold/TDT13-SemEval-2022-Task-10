    "text": "Since coming to power , Bush , proceeding from the US immediate interests , has also adopted the pragmatism and unilateralism position with regard to international treaties . This March , catering to the interests of the US oil and coal barons who have made large political donations to the Republican Party , Bush announced , without prior consultations with its allies , that the United States would not enforce the \" Kyoto Protocol \" which is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the world . This announcement was met with unanimous condemnation by the international media .",
