    "text": "They are relatively mild for our country . We are not required to reduce emissions , but over five years ( from 2008 through 2012 ) we do not have the right to exceed their volume . This approach is based on the fact that Russia 's emissions today are almost 25 percent lower than in 1990 , and , according to forecasts , the baseline level will not be reached in the next 10 years . This is substantiated in detail in the RF Energy Strategy Until 2020 , which the government has adopted . Within the framework of the protocol our country must maintain records of , and monitor , emissions and emission quotas , as well as regulate quotas . This requires creating a national system of inventorying emissions and establishing a special registration center to maintain records of quotas . Despite the outward complexity of the task , the creation of a record - keeping and monitoring system is neither very complicated nor very expensive , since the Goskomstat [ State Statistical Committee ] reporting forms that enterprises fill out contain virtually complete data .",
