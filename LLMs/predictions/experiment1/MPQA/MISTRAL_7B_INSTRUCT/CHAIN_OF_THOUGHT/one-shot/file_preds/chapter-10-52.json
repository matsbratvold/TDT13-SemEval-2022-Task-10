    "text": "On the afternoon of 9/11 , according to contemporaneous notes , Secretary Rumsfeld instructed General Myers to obtain quickly as much information as possible . The notes indicate that he also told Myers that he was not simply interested in striking empty training sites . He thought the U.S. response should consider a wide range of options and possibilities . The secretary said his instinct was to hit Saddam Hussein at the same time - not only Bin Ladin . Secretary Rumsfeld later explained that at the time , he had been considering either one of them , or perhaps someone else , as the responsible party .",
