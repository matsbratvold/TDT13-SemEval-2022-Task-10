    "text": "When Air Force One landed at Barksdale at about 11:45 , personnel from the local Secret Service office were still en route to the airfield . The motorcade consisted of a military police lead vehicle and a van ; the proposed briefing theater had no phones or electrical outlets . Staff scrambled to prepare another room for the President 's remarks , while the lead Secret Service agent reviewed the security situation with superiors in Washington . The President completed his statement , which for security reasons was taped and not broadcast live , and the traveling party returned to Air Force One . The next destination was discussed : once again the Secret Service recommended against returning to Washington , and the Vice President agreed . Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska was chosen because of its elaborate command and control facilities , and because it could accommodate overnight lodging for 50 persons . The Secret Service wanted a place where the President could spend several days , if necessary .",
