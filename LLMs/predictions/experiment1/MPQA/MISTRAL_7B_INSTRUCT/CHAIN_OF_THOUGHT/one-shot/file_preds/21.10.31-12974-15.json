    "text": "The gist is that , according to the Kyoto terms , quotas can be sold , that is , if you have fewer emissions than your neighbor , then you have every reason to strike an advantageous deal . True , this clause has been stirring up a lot of questions for a long time . The discussants also presented differing views on the trading of air . Some of the participants took the line that this is an extremely useful for Russia , which has \" hot air \" ( that is , it is 30 percent short of the permitted level of CO2 emissions ) , and the country can become the dominant seller in the market ; consequently , it has a greater stake than anyone in the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol . We will also gain from the fact that compliance by other nations with the terms of the protocol will lead to higher demand for gas , of which we have huge resources . So if anyone doubts whether Russia should ratify the document , he is deeply mistaken .",
