    "text": "What 's with the top - of - the - front headline the LAT puts over its picture of Martina Hingis standing next to Venus Williams after beating her at the U.S. Open --\" Venus Brought Back to Earth \" ? Does n't that sound like celebrating a defeat rather than celebrating a victory ? How odd -- and a good illustration of how trying to shoe - horn in a \" witty \" headline can drive you into an idea that does n't fit or is undeserved . Given that Ms. Williams ' parents are rather protective of her and that she is a black in a still pretty - lilly - white sport , do n't be surprised if there 's a bit of a complaint about this .",
