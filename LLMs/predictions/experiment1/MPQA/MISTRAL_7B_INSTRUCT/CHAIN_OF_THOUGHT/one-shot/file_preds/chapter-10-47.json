    "text": "The pre-9/11 draft presidential directive on al Qaeda evolved into a new directive , National Security Presidential Directive 9 , now titled \" Defeating the Terrorist Threat to the United States . \" The directive would now extend to a global war on terrorism , not just on al Qaeda . It also incorporated the President 's determination not to distinguish between terrorists and those who harbor them . It included a determination to use military force if necessary to end al Qaeda 's sanctuary in Afghanistan . The new directive - formally signed on October 25 , after the fighting in Afghanistan had already begun - included new material followed by annexes discussing each targeted terrorist group . The old draft directive on al Qaeda became , in effect , the first annex .",
