    "text": "According to the analysis of Chomsky , after World War II , the US think tank had planned to subjugate a few regions of the world for its economic progress . The Middle East and many countries of the Third World were part of the plan . During the same period , anti-Soviet hysteria was also promoted strongly . The CIA was given the task to topple governments and install rulers of its own choice . As a result , the governments in Guatemala in 1954 and 1963 , Dominican Republic in 1984 , Brazil in 1965 and that of Chile in 1973 were toppled .",
