    "text": "It was preceded by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change . It was adopted on 9 May 1992 and entered into force 21 March 1994 . A total of 186 nations are parties to the convention , including Russia , all of the developed countries and all of the CIS countries . The convention was designed to unite efforts to prevent dangerous climate changes and to achieve a stabilization of the content of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at a relatively safe level . A decision was adopted at the first conference of convention participants ( 1995 , Berlin ) to begin phased actions to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases and to create an appropriate system of ecological - economic relations .",
