    "text": "Should we be happy about climate change ? Many people in Russia say : how much fuel we'll save ! But the warming will definitely not be uniform . If the mean temperature rises by 2 degrees , the range of fluctuations will widen and will go , for example , from - 40 to + 45 degrees . So there will not be less of a need for fuel if , on the average , one winter out of every three winters becomes much colder than the harshest previous one . And what will happen during the new , overly warm summer seasons ? What will happen to industrial and transport facilities , housing and other infrastructure that were built in permafrost , which will turn into muddy swamp ?",
