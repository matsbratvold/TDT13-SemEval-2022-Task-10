Indeed , since their arrival at Camp - X - Ray , some of the terrorists have openly threatened the Marines who guard them and talk anxiously about returning home soon to continue terrorizing the American people .",

        "text": "June 26 , 1995 Dear Friend : This is not newsletter . It is a fund - raising appeal . But there 's no reason why we should n't share good news at the same time . Federal , state and local governments are freezing or withdrawing much - needed funding sources for people who are truly in need . In spite of that , Pleasant Run Children 's Homes , with the help of hundreds of volunteers and others who really care , continues to make a significant impact on the futures of families and kids in need of help . We all hear about today 's increases in neglect , abuse and abandonment of those who ca n't fight back : children . Yet few of us hear enough about kids who live through these adversities and do make the grade . The positive side . These are special children . They come into a Pleasant Run program ... whether it 's for therapeutic help in their own homes ( which nurtures whole families ) , through foster care families or in the familial surroundings of our residential homes . For some , it 's a matter of weeks or months ; for others , it 's years . They leave Pleasant Run , generally , ready and able to contribute to society . We 're proud of our children and all that they overcome . We are a not - for - profit , multi - service agency . We would n't exist if the need were n't there . The numbers of children who deserve our services are rising ... as quickly as our programs can grow to serve them . Please help us help them . Pleasant Run Children 's Homes ... \" where good kids get better . \" Sincerely , Mary Roth Tom Hirschauer",

        "text": "It 's hard to believe that the holiday season is only two months away . At Pleasant Run , Inc . we are making plans and arrangements for our children and families . Every year we seek companies , organizations and individuals to sponsor one or more of our families . These families are participants in our community - based programs . These programs focus on keeping the family together by providing counseling and other services to the entire family . After our caseworkers meet with these families and their children they often find they lack even the basic necessities such as cooking utensils , beds , cleaning supplies , etc . We meet these needs immediately . But , the holiday season is a particularly difficult time for these families . They do not have the resources necessary to purchase gifts or food for a holiday meal . We are asking you to consider sponsoring one of our families for this holiday season . If you are interested and would like more information , please contact Lisa Lusk or Marcia Whited at 693-9222 . We would like to have families matched with sponsors non later than xxxx . Thank you for considering this opportunity to make this a memorable holiday season for a family in need . Sincerely ,",

As you begin that process this year , I would like to ask you to consider helping young people in Marion County toward more positive youth development by becoming a supporter of the Marion County Commission on Youth , Inc. MCCOY Inc. , originally founded as a government agency but re-organized in 1993 as an independent not - for - profit , is a county - wide youth services coordinating , planning , and convening agency . Its purpose is to encourage collaboration and cooperation between the various agencies , programs , and systems that serve our community 's youth . In addition to that behind - the - scenes role , MCCOY has taken an out - front role in developing a Summer Bus Pass , neighborhood youth councils , and the We Value Youth information line . It is our goal that every young person in Marion County have access to the programs and services that can best assist them in their growth toward a positive adulthood . I am hopeful that you as an individual and Meridian Insurance as a corporation might consider becoming sustaining supporters of MCCOY . I have enclosed a packet of information about MCCOY and its work as well as an application with various options for supporting the youth of our community . I obviously ca n't tell the whole story of MCCOY in a single letter but I hope this provides an overview of the scope of our work . I will call you in a few weeks to discuss your level of interest . Please consider joining together with your fellow citizens in support of the work of the Marion County Commission on Youth . Sincerely , John Brandon Executive Director",

        "text": "August 6 , 1998 Dear Friend : Adolescence . It is a pivotal time in the life of a young girl - when small changes in her behavior , or the choices she makes , can affect her future . It 's hard enough for her to make good decisions when she 's surrounded by support . It 's even harder when she is n't . Big Sisters helps fill that void by matching caring , responsible adult volunteers with at - risk girls , ages 8 - 14 . A Big Sister is a mentor , a friend and a role model , helping a young girl to develop the self - confidence and life skills necessary to become a responsible , productive and successful adult . Your $ 1,000 contribution can put a mentor in a child 's life - and hope in a child 's future . The results of an 18 - month study completed by Public / Private Ventures showed that children participating in one - to - one Big Sister and Big Brother matches for just one year , reduced first time drug use by 46 % ; lowered school absenteeism by 52 % ; cut aggressive behavior by 33 % ; enhanced school performance ; and improved relations with family and friends . This is positive proof that Big Sisters one - to - one mentoring program helps change lives . Today , we are offering you the opportunity to help change a life . By contributing $ 1,000 you can support one match for one year . This money maintains the infrastructure that fosters and supports the development of effective relationships . This includes a volunteer screening process , orientation , training and ongoing supervision and support by a professional staff . As a Matchmaker you will receive a description of \" your match \" and be identified as a Matchmaker on a plaque in the Big Sisters office , in the agency newsletter and annual report . Today Big Sisters serves over 1,000 girls in central Indiana . But for each girl served , more are left unserved . Over 235 girls are currently waiting for a Big Sister . Imagine the difference the community could make if each congregation pledged its support of one Big Sisters match ! I encourage you to Join me in presenting this matchmaker challenge to your congregation . Sincerely , Dr. Linda McCoy Pastor , THE GARDEN A Blossom of St. Luke 's United Methodist Church",

In this operation , the manner in which defenseless , innocent and poor Muslims were blown up by ammunition is one of the most dreadful events in history . The whole world witnessed this loathsome action by the United States , but no one -- including the Muslim community -- raised a voice against this horrifying act of oppression .

By declaring Iraq , Iran and North Korea as ' axis of evil ' , the United States has announced to target these countries in the same manner as ! Afghanistan . North Korea has also been made the target due to the reason that according to the United States , it is being blamed for transferring nuclear technology and weapons to Islamic countries .

The report cites Convergence Deputy Alejandro Arzola saying that Powell 's position clearly reflects the concern that exists in the international community and Latin America over the Venezuelan situation : the atmosphere of conflict and the threats against freedom of expression , democracy , and legal security . Arzola stated : \" The government 's positions are not only harming the country at the domestic level , but also at the international level because thousands of investors are watching on their television sets what is happening in Venezuela , where the rule of law is under fire . \" Arzola added : Any recommendation by a country friendly to Venezuela , especially a country that is Venezuela 's No.1 trade partner , must be heeded , as well as recommendations by the Church and the nation , which is demanding a rectification . The report also cites Democratic Action leader Claudio Fermin , who warned : \" When Chavez came to the Presidency , the United States was buying 1.75 million barrels a day . At present , because of the misguided policy of cutting production , we are only selling them 1.1 million barrels . If to this , we add the President 's constant aggressive attitude and readiness to establish ties between Venezuela and parasitic economies that give us nothing , but fulfill his political commitments , we will very likely continue to lose our edge in the US market . \" According to Fermin , the chief of state still does not understand that if there is no confidence , there will be no investments . Movement Toward Socialism Deputy Julio Montoya stated : \" The national government has been extremely incompetent in handling relations with the United States . It has been vague about Venezuela 's intentions regarding the protection of crude prices and the war on terrorism . Ambiguous situations constitute a breeding ground for bilateral tensions and the fact that currently , we do not even have an ambassador in Washington indicates that we are on the verge of a major breakdown in our relations with our leading trade partner . \" ]",

The international community and even US western allies , including US neighbor Canada , have consistently opposed the plan . Despite the opposition , Bush went it alone . One of the main US diplomatic goals for this year is to persuade the international community to accept the NMD and Russia to agree to revise the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty [ AMD ] by flashing a carrot on a stick . At one time , he said the new US missile defense system would not pose a threat to the international security and would not trigger an arms race ; on another occasion , he stated the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed by the Soviet Union and the United States in 1972 was \" a product of the Cold War era , \" and thus has lost its binding force . He even claimed that to develop the NMD , the United States would be even prepared to scrap the ABM . Over the past year , Bush increased funds for research and testing for the N ! MD and accelerated the test frequency of the anti-missile system . Even after the adoption of the resolution on \" maintaining and abiding by the \" Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty \" on 29 November at the 56th United Nations General Assembly , the United States still persisted in carrying out a fifth missile interception test . In a word , the US development of the NMD is for the purpose of \" attacking other countries and at the same time preventing other countries from attacking it , \" thereby genuinely securing its status of being the \" sole super power . \"",

The responsibility for the event , in which a Chinese plane crashed and a Chinese pilot perished , lies completely with the US side . The US side not only refused to apologize to China but also claimed that \" US crew members were detained by the Chinese side . \" It was only because of it being deterred by the Chinese Government 's firm position and due to the fact that the US crew members were still in China that the United States was compelled to offer an apology . But after the Chinese side released all the US crew members , major US political figures changed their stance immediately and threatened to use human rights , trade , and Olympics hosting issues to \" retaliate \" against China .",

        "text": "Barcelona , 14 March : The current president of the EU , Jose Maria Aznar , and the president of the European Commission , Romano Prodi , have handed over a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin in which they urge him to promote the ratification by Russia of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change . In the letter , to which Efe has had access , Aznar and Prodi explain that on 4 March the council of EU environment ministers agreed the adoption of a decision for approval of the Kyoto Protocol on climate change on behalf of the European Community . They explain that this agreement is an important step for the EU in fulfilling the political pledge to achieve ratification of the Protocol before the Johannesburg summit on sustainable development . To this end , Aznar and Prodi report that only the internal ratification processes in each of the member states have now to be concluded and they emphasize that these are at an advanced stage and in some cases have been completed . \" Therefore , we have complete confidence that the instruments of ratification of the European Community and of the 15 member states will be able to be lodged with the Secretariat of the United Nations within the time scale anticipated , in other words , in early June of this year , \" they add . However , the letter emphasizes that for the Kyoto Protocol to be able to enter into force in the near future it is not enough for EU ratification to be guaranteed and they thus urge Putin to ensure that Russia also moves ahead with ratification . They make this request \" convinced of the Russian Federation 's resolute commitment to the Kyoto Protocol \" and believing that in this manner the EU and Russia would continue to show the \" leadership \" which they believe they have shared \" with such fruitful results , in international cooperation in the fight against climate change \" .",

This approach is based on the fact that Russia 's emissions today are almost 25 percent lower than in 1990 , and , according to forecasts , the baseline level will not be reached in the next 10 years . This is substantiated in detail in the RF Energy Strategy Until 2020 , which the government has adopted . Within the framework of the protocol our country must maintain records of , and monitor , emissions and emission quotas , as well as regulate quotas . This requires creating a national system of inventorying emissions and establishing a special registration center to maintain records of quotas . Despite the outward complexity of the task , the creation of a record - keeping and monitoring system is neither very complicated nor very expensive , since the Goskomstat [ State Statistical Committee ] reporting forms that enterprises fill out contain virtually complete data .",

Participants in the debate also proceeded from the postulate that the earth 's atmosphere has been heating up over the past 100 years . It is another matter that the reasons for this alarming phenomenon are not completely clear , and experts offer different interpretations of the consequences of global warming . Rumor has it that the late author of the greenhouse model told Academician Roald Sagdeyev : \" I'm a little uneasy when I tell the Americans about my model , because it suggests that Russia 's agriculture will gain from global warming , while America 's agriculture will lose . \" Sagdeyev looked at Budyko with interest : \" But then where will we buy grain ? \"",

So there will not be less of a need for fuel if , on the average , one winter out of every three winters becomes much colder than the harshest previous one .

Dispersion is less active , and so - called obstruction or stagnant situation manifest themselves in the atmosphere more and more often . We have just observed such a case of a very lengthy thaw in the center of Russia . Incidentally , last year 's incredibly cold winter in Primorskiy Kray was very possibly an example of the same property .

Russian First Deputy Fuel and Energy Minister Ivan Matlashov made this announcement during a bilateral roundtable discussion coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the USSR - Iraq Friendship and Cooperation Treaty . Russian companies will have exported 118.6 million barrels of oil from Iraq during the six - month phase ending on May 29 , Matlashov said . During the 10th phase , lasting between June and November 2001 , Russian companies sold 115.3 million barrels . Russian companies will have sold around 1 billion barrels of Iraqi crude for approximately $ 15 billion during all 11 phases stipulated in the 1996 Iraq - UN memorandum . This accounts for roughly 40 % of Iraq 's total oil exports , he said . In April , the UN Sanctions Committee will probably lift restrictions from Russia - Iraq contracts in different spheres valued at about $ 900 million . The United Nations has allowed the implementation of contracts worth some $ 200 million . Of this , Russia 's Zarubezhneft foreign trade organization secured 45 contracts valued at about $ 140 million . Zarubezhneft has shipped $ 45 million worth of equipment and materials in keeping with 33 contracts . The Iraqi side has pledged to \" take into consideration the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry 's recommendations \" related to allocation of oil export quotas to its Russian partners .",

Dostum 's units are currently fighting near Mazar - e - Sharif , aiming , in particular , to seize control of populated areas in Samangan Province to block weapons supplies to Taleban units in Mazar - e - Sharif , Dostum said in an interview published in the Tuesday edition of Moskovskiye Novosti . The general said he currently commands up to 18,000 men , and about 4,000 Taleban fighters \" with military hardware \" have already gone over to his side . The US air strikes have destroyed Taleban emplacements near Mazar - e - Sharif , Dostum said . He also denied reports that the Taleban had concentrated large forces near the border with Uzbekistan . \" There are no such forces on the border with Uzbekistan . In Hayraton , near the Uzbek town of Termez , there are slightly over 100 Taleban members , according to my estimations , \" he said . Dostum said he intends to serve in the future Afghan government , representing ethnic Uzbeks . Moreover , Taleban fighters \" not stained with blood \" could be in this government , too , he said . Dostum also favoured a possible return of Afghanistan 's former King Mohammad Zaher Shah .",

        "text": "MOSCOW . May 23 ( Interfax ) - The Russian Aerospace Agency is continuing its active search for a space tourist candidate who would fly to the International Space Station ( ISS ) in autumn , agency director Yuri Koptev told Interfax on Thursday . The agency has received three official applications for a commercial flight . A source in space circles told Interfax that the applications came from one Russian citizen , a woman from Australia and one more unnamed person . In line with established rules , the agency is processing the applications . In the meantime , two Americans , a singer from the boy group NSYNC Lance Bass and former NASA Associate Administrator Lori Garver , are completing medical examinations at the Institute for Biomedical Problems in Moscow to be okayed for a flight . At a joint news conference in Moscow this month , Interfax was told that both Americans are expected to announce intentions to fly to space . The Russian pop group Na - Na has not given up plans for a space flight either . The singers passed the necessary medical tests last year . However , the Russian Aerospace Agency told Interfax that it has not received any official applications from either the Americans or the Russian pop group . It added that there is growing public interest in space tourism around the world , and that it is now seen as a vehicle for increasing personal popularity . At the moment , the probability of the third space tourist making a space flight this year is 70 - 80 % , informed sources told Interfax on Thursday . The set of services related to a taxi mission to the ISS on a Russian spaceship ranges between $ 18 and $ 20 million , agency sources said .",

Attorney General John Ashcroft told us that he saw his job in directing this effort as \" risk minimization , \" both to find out who had committed the attacks and to prevent a subsequent attack . Ashcroft ordered all special interest immigration hearings closed to the public , family members , and press ; directed government attorneys to seek denial of bond until such time as they were \" cleared \" of terrorist connections by the FBI and other agencies ; and ordered the identity of the detainees kept secret . INS attorneys charged with prosecuting the immigration violations had trouble getting information about the detainees and any terrorist connections ; in the chaos after the attacks , it was very difficult to reach law enforcement officials , who were following up on other leads .

Guidelines on this subject issued in August 2001 by Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson essentially recapitulated prior guidance . However , the attacks of 9/11 changed everything . Less than one week after September 11 , an early version of what was to become the Patriot Act ( officially , the USA PATRIOT Act ) began to take shape . A central provision of the proposal was the removal of \" the wall \" on information sharing between the intelligence and law enforcement communities ( discussed in chapter 3 ) . Ashcroft told us he was determined to take every conceivable action , within the limits of the Constitution , to identify potential terrorists and deter additional attacks . The administration developed a proposal that eventually passed both houses of Congress by large majorities and was signed into law on October 26 .",

Vice President Cheney described the President 's mood as somber . The long day was not yet over . When the larger meeting that included his domestic department heads broke up , President Bush chaired a smaller meeting of top advisers , a group he would later call his \" war council . \" This group usually included Vice President Cheney , Secretary of State Powell , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , General Hugh Shelton , Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs ( later to become chairman ) General Myers , DCI Tenet , Attorney General Ashcroft , and FBI Director Robert Mueller . From the White House staff , National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and Chief of Staff Card were part of the core group , often joined by their deputies , Stephen Hadley and Joshua Bolten . In this restricted National Security Council meeting , the President said it was a time for self - defense . The United States would punish not just the perpetrators of the attacks , but also those who harbored them . Secretary Powell said the United States had to make it clear to Pakistan , Afghanistan , and the Arab states that the time to act was now . He said we would need to build a coalition . The President noted that the attacks provided a great opportunity to engage Russia and China . Secretary Rumsfeld urged the President and the principals to think broadly about who might have harbored the attackers , including Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya , Sudan , and Iran . He wondered aloud how much evidence the United States would need in order to deal with these countries , pointing out that major strikes could take up to 60 days to assemble .",

As a former pilot , the President was struck by the apparent sophistication of the operation and some of the piloting , especially Hanjour 's high - speed dive into the Pentagon . He told us he recalled Iraqi support for Palestinian suicide terrorists as well . Speculating about other possible states that could be involved , the President told us he also thought about Iran .",

The memo found no \" compelling case \" that Iraq had either planned or perpetrated the attacks . It passed along a few foreign intelligence reports , including the Czech report alleging an April 2001 Prague meeting between Atta and an Iraqi intelligence officer ( discussed in chapter 7 ) and a Polish report that personnel at the headquarters of Iraqi intelligence in Baghdad were told before September 11 to go on the streets to gauge crowd reaction to an unspecified event . Arguing that the case for links between Iraq and al Qaeda was weak , the memo pointed out that Bin Ladin resented the secularism of Saddam Hussein 's regime .

Wolfowitz contended that the odds were \" far more \" than 1 in 10 , citing Saddam 's praise for the attack , his long record of involvement in terrorism , and theories that Ramzi Yousef was an Iraqi agent and Iraq was behind the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center . The next day , Wolfowitz renewed the argument , writing to Rumsfeld about the interest of Yousef 's co-conspirator in the 1995 Manila air plot in crashing an explosives - laden plane into CIA headquarters , and about information from a foreign government regarding Iraqis ' involvement in the attempted hijacking of a Gulf Air flight . Given this background , he wondered why so little thought had been devoted to the danger of suicide pilots , seeing a \" failure of imagination \" and a mind - set that dismissed possibilities .",

In Phase Three , the United States would carry out \" decisive operations \" using all elements of national power , including ground troops , to topple the Taliban regime and eliminate al Qaeda 's sanctuary in Afghanistan . Mazar - e - Sharif , in northern Afghanistan , fell to a coalition assault by Afghan and U.S. forces on November 9 . Four days later the Taliban had fled from Kabul .
