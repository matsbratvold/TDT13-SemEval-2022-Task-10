    "text": "As for all the ideas regarding blocking shields , umbrellas and the like , I will answer this way . The Kyoto Protocol proposes adapting to climate change . There are no proposals there to erect screens or to shoot cooling aerosols into the atmosphere . Already everything humankind does causes incredible damage to nature . We emit greenhouse gases , we thaw out the frozen regions that emit methane , we destroy forests , and in the south , deserts are expanding , a process that alters the heat exchange between the earth 's surface and the atmosphere . That is , all of our actions are accompanied by a deterioration in the climate . In this situation it is very frightening to do anything else -- for example , to suspend some umbrella , screen or something else in that vein .",
