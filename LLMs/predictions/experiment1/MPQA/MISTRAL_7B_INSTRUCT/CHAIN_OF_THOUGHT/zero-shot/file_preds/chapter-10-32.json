    "text": "At the September 13 NSC meeting , when Secretary Powell described Pakistan 's reply , President Bush led a discussion of an appropriate ultimatum to the Taliban . He also ordered Secretary Rumsfeld to develop a military plan against the Taliban . The President wanted the United States to strike the Taliban , step back , wait to see if they got the message , and hit them hard if they did not . He made clear that the military should focus on targets that would influence the Taliban 's behavior .",
