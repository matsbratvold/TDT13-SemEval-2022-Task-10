    "text": "Military violence constitutes -- in very exceptional circumstances -- a necessary evil in this very imperfect world . That is a bitter pill to swallow in a thoroughly non-militaristic society such as ours , where the clash of weapons provokes healthy reactions of repulsion . But unfortunately there is little one can do about it . Without armed violence the Nazi regime and similar forces that had the wind in their sails in Europe in the 1930s , would not have fallen . In the battle against the new forms of terrorism that reached a tragic culmination on 11 September , a limited form of military violence could also not be ruled out .",
