    "text": "Flights of Saudi Nationals Leaving the United States Three questions have arisen with respect to the departure of Saudi nationals from the United States in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 : ( 1 ) Did any flights of Saudi nationals take place before national airspace reopened on September 13 , 2001 ? ( 2 ) Was there any political intervention to facilitate the departure of Saudi nationals ? ( 3 ) Did the FBI screen Saudi nationals thoroughly before their departure ? First , we found no evidence that any flights of Saudi nationals , domestic or international , took place before the reopening of national airspace on the morning of September 13 , 2001 . To the contrary , every flight we have identified occurred after national airspace reopened .",
