    "text": "Apparently President Bush 's attitude looks like a reaction to the events of 11 September 2001 . American intellectual Noam Chomsky has proved in his writings that the accomplishment of its goals by aggression and terrorism is a part of the American psyche . This can be traced back to the events in 1818 , when American cowboys used blind force to oppress the blacks . Since then , the United States has been raising artificial slogans of preservation of democracy and human rights and developing standards of living . The actual US objective is the protection of its own interests worldwide for which it does not care for any moral values .",
