    "text": "Nikolay Ratsiborinskiy , a senior adviser to the Foreign Ministry 's Department of International Organizations , took up this role . He described the opinion that Russia can gain from perturbations of the climate as false . \" When we determine the position of the diplomatic service , we proceed from the premise that the whole strategy of nature - conservation efforts is not profitable but costly and that it is impossible to solve the problems of environmental protection on our own ... The Kyoto mechanism is costly , but its value lies in the fact that its implementation has been tied to the market mechanism , that is , life without change has been made uneconomical . \"",
