The LAT , for instance , examines what it takes to be a new \" cuddly - feely \" Britain born of the national grief experience . But USAT and the WP also each run pretty newsy Diana pieces as well . Both reveal that Tony Blair had conferred with Diana about a goodwill ambassador job shortly before her death , and USAT reports that Le Figaro says a dying Diana gave two crash witnesses a message for her family and children .",
