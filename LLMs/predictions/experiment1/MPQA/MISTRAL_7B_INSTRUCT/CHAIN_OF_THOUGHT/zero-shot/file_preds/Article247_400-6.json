    "text": "The Wall Street Journal \" Outlook \" observes , \" In the U.S. job market , the balance of power is shifting to employees from employers , \" and states that \" the retention frenzy was triggered in part by previous waves of corporate downsizing , \" which left behind survivors who took stock of career options and used Internet job listings and intensified recruiting to land better offers , which in turn led to counter - offers and higher salaries . This has led , says the Journal , to annual compensation rising 5 - 6 percent a year .",
