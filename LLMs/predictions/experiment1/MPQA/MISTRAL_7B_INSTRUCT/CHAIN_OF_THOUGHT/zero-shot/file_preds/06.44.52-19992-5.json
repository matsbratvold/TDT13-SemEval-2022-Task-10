    "text": "GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE , Cuba - It begins as a shiny speck in the southeast skies of the lone landing strip here at Gitmo , the oldest U.S. base overseas . Within minutes the lumbering , gray C - 141B Starlifter flies low over the tarmac and over a patch of palm trees , as if part of an annual air show . On a hot and windy afternoon , the deep blue waters of the Caribbean serve as the postcard backdrop .",
