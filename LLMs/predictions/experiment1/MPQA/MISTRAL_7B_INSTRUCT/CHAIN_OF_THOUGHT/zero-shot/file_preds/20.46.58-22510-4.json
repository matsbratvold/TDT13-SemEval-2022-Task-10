    "text": "Indeed , the U.S Administration , which claims to advocate international human rights issues and which tries to play the role of a world policeman , is actually condoning the most atrocious human rights violations committed in the United States itself . The ugliest crimes are perpetrated against inmates in U.S. prisons , and the mistreatment of ethnic minorities by the U.S. police is so appalling that on several occasions it has led to massive riots . For instance , a bloody riot was ignited in Cincinnati when an Afro - American youth was shot dead for no reason by police officers .",
