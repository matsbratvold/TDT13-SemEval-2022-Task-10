Some species are disappearing , while others , conversely , are starting to multiply will unprecedented speed . Gangster species are appearing , such as the locust , which is moving toward the north , where it has never been before . It is hard to say today what will happen to edaphic microflora , which is of fundamental importance to soil fertility . If microflora stop reproducing humus , the higher plants will die , agricultural crops will stop growing , and timber will start to dry up .",
