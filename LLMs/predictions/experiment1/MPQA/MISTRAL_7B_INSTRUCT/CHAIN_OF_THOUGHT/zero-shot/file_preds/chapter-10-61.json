    "text": "Within the Pentagon , Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz continued to press the case for dealing with Iraq . Writing to Rumsfeld on September 17 in a memo headlined \" Preventing More Events , \" he argued that if there was even a 10 percent chance that Saddam Hussein was behind the 9/11 attack , maximum priority should be placed on eliminating that threat . Wolfowitz contended that the odds were \" far more \" than 1 in 10 , citing Saddam 's praise for the attack , his long record of involvement in terrorism , and theories that Ramzi Yousef was an Iraqi agent and Iraq was behind the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center . The next day , Wolfowitz renewed the argument , writing to Rumsfeld about the interest of Yousef 's co-conspirator in the 1995 Manila air plot in crashing an explosives - laden plane into CIA headquarters , and about information from a foreign government regarding Iraqis ' involvement in the attempted hijacking of a Gulf Air flight . Given this background , he wondered why so little thought had been devoted to the danger of suicide pilots , seeing a \" failure of imagination \" and a mind - set that dismissed possibilities .",
