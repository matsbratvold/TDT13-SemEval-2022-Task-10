You are performing structured sentiment analysis on a text.
Follow the steps below to complete the task.

1: Extract the following entities from the text, reasoning why they are extracted:
- Opinion subjects: subjects that express an opinion. In most cases there is no explicit opinion holder, so use this with caution.
- Opinion targets: the entities that are being opined about.
- Sentiment expressions: an expression that describes a sentiment about a target. This can be a single word, or a phrase.
Note that some texts might have no sentiment expressions.

2: For each sentiment expression, determine who is the holder of the opinion, and who is the target of the opinion, reasoning why.
In some cases, there might be no holder, or no target.

3: For each sentiment expression, determine the polarity of the sentiment, and the intensity of the sentiment, give the reasons why.


4: Answer on the following format, and if there are no sentiment expressions, return an empty list:
{ 
    "opinions": [
        {
            "Source": subject, 
            "Target": target, 
            "Polar_expression": sentiment expression,
            "Polarity": polarity sentiment label ('Negative', 'Positive', 'Neutral'),
            "Intensity": sentiment intensity ('Average', 'Strong', 'Weak')
        },
    ]
}
