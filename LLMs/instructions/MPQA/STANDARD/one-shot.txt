Here is an example: 
You are given the text "The US President preferred a more realistic attitude , 
because it is hard to believe that it will be possible to fully eliminate pollutant gas emissions in 
one decade . What is also realistic is the idea that it will be easier to persuade the main polluting agents
to take measures by providing incentives to them , rather than by constraint . 
No matter how cynical this may appear , the US administration is mainly concerned with getting out of
the recession and with relaunching the economy , rather than with the greenhouse effect ."

The answer should be: 
{
    "opinions": [
        {
            "Source": "The US President",
            "Target": "a more realistic attitude",
            "Polar_expression": "preferred",
            "Polarity": "Positive",
            "Intensity": "Weak"
        }
    ]
}
