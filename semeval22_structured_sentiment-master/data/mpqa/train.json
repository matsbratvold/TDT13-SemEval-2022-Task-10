In 1998 , MCCOY , Inc. led two efforts that , we believe , will help our community continue to take the steps necessary to help all young people grow up and develop well . Participants in the Youth Outcomes Educational Initiative identified three goals for all our youth to obtain : economic self - sufficiency , healthy family , social relationships , and involvement in the community . A short time later , the Community Youth Mapping Project sent 55 young people out into the community to identify the resources they need to grow up well : caring adults , safe places to go , and positive things to do . One group of adults and one group of youth , through two very different processes , have arrived at the same conclusion ; our community still has much to do if we are to help ALL of your youth successfully develop into the responsible , productive adults who will our community in the future . As a provider of youth services , MCCOY , Inc. is here to support your valuable efforts to develop young people . Recently , through a lot of hard work and alliances with organizations like yours , some steps have been taken in our community that will help young people continue to be involved in positive activities . One , IndyGo in April adopted a much - needed policy that all young people under the age of 19 may ride on their buses at half the normal fare all year long . Two , funding was made available this summer for youth organizations and churches to conduct positive youth programming on Saturday evenings . Through the youth mapping process , it was confirmed that the positive opportunities for youth on weekend evenings were lacking . That need is being met . As it has been an exciting year for all of us , MCCOY , Inc. cannot do its part without the support of organizations like yours . Annually , we ask several of our youth serving organizations to join us in our effort to help young people grow up well in Indianapolis . Enclosed is a donation card that will enable you to make Indianapolis a great place for ALL of us to live . If you have any questions or concerns at any time , please do not hesitate to call me at 921-1288 . Sincerely , John F. Brandon , President MCCOY , Inc .",

After Putin 's statement they rubbed their palms at length . It amounted to much more than what one could have expected . The military great power that towers over Afghanistan has committed itself to overthrow the ruling Taliban system , and has pledged to support the US \" anti-terrorism military operation \" now being prepared . Putin has exceeded the \" positive neutrality policy \" his country ( the Soviet Union at the time ) has pursued during the Gulf War , and whose continued validity the military leaders also regarded as desirable . The situation in which Putin has agreed to open former Soviet military airfields to American armed forces in three ( former Soviet ) Central Asian countries could be regarded as dramatic . These countries are Tajikistan , Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan . Although these are sovereign states , and the final decision would have been in their hands , people familiar with the actual balance of power indicate that these states would have done nothing , had Moscow wanted a different thing to happen .",

Putin has written the name of Moscow on the registration page of the American side . He wanted to become an ally , and that 's what he has become . But making this complex decision was not easy for him . Reformers told Putin all along that he should take advantage of \" the rare opportunity for ( Russia ) to become integrated with the civilized world . \" But main stream Russian military policy has been to keep a distance from America , the country that has been historically responsible for \" educating \" the Taliban that had caused the demise of Soviet occupation forces in Afghanistan . In the end , a certain consideration that differed from the above two proved to be decisive . It had to do with Chechnya . Putin has no greater desire than to present to the West the Chechen independence movement as a chapter of \" international terror . \" He did not succeed with that so far . He was criticized more than recognized for his policy . At this time however , he taught a lesson to the Americans . After the Americans had promised everything good and nice , Putin remarked almost as an aside that the events in Chechnia \" could be interpreted only in the context of the struggle against international terrorism . \" In reality , Putin asked for a free hand regarding Chechnia , some understanding , or even that the Americans look the other way . Putin did not receive what he sought in a quick response from Washington , namely , that the State Department would continue to encourage political dialogue between Moscow and the Chechen insurgents . Nevertheless , one could not fail taking note of the fact that in the same response the United States called upon the Chechens to \" unconditionally and without delay to terminate every contact with international terrorist groups , \" and that they accept Putin 's offer to make peace . If we view this warning against the background that Putin 's government has always seen Usama Bin Ladin 's hands behind \" Chechen terrorism , \" we were witnessing a late recognition of Moscow 's views .",

So they would fill little bags for us and we would give them a nickel and we could take that to the movie theatre with us . And that 's all the stories I can remember about the movies right now . I do know that I did used to go the movie downtown at the Carolina Theatre . And when I was young , it was n't a strange thing for the kids to just go off and go to a movie . I mean , my mother knew where we were going and she knew when we would get back , but today you would n't send your seven or eight year old child to a movie theatre alone even if they were with their nine year old brother ; you just would n't do it . And we could skate to the movie or ride a bicycle to the movie and we would do that . Which is kind of sad that you ca n't do that anymore and it 's not just because things are , there 're bad people in the world but it 's too much traffic . You have to check everything about a movie , check it out to see what the content is and just was n't like that when I was growing up . Also about that same time period in my life , I guess again between seven and ten years old , which seems to be what I remember most vividly , my best friend uh , was Kathy Josey , and she was a next door neighbor also , and we remained friends up until , uh , she was about 35 and she passed away with cancer . But we , we remained close friends . In fact we shared an apartment , first apartment either one of us ever had . And when we were , um , little girls we used to play \" Career Girls \" !",

But we had , Kathy had one pair of pearls or beads of some sort of necklace that was her mother 's and I did n't have the necklace . And it was really beautiful and I really , really wanted one . So we only had the one necklace and we , er , we decided , I do n't know if it was jointly or if Kathy was just extremely nice of whatever , but she said I could wear it part of the time . And we would literally time the amount of time , we wore it like 30 minutes or 15 minutes or whatever . And the way we decided who got to wear it first , and this always kind of bothered me because I know Kathy did this intentionally , she said the youngest one got to wear it first and she was like six months younger than I am . So , it , that became a normal thing with us . Whenever we only had one of something she would always say , \" Well , I think the youngest one gets to do it , or wear it or whatever first . \" And , that just always stuck in my mind , that in , in our adult life I brought that up to her and she sort of acted like she did n't know anything about that and I thought to myself , \" she does , \" and then she laughed about it and she realized that she had kinda held a trump card on that one . Um , also we did a lot of pretending and as I said we played career girls and the dress ups . And my sister and I used to pretend also and Jill is about 2 years younger than I am , maybe two and a half , and we used to play Robin Hood except we did n't have a Maid Marion , we had a Saretha , I do n't know where in the world that name came from . But we would switch playing Robin Hood , one would play Robin Hood and one would play Saretha . And Saretha was the counter , would be the same thing as Maid Marion , and , why , again , I do n't know why we did n't use Maid Marion . But in my mind I can remember playing that , like all day long . And we would go over to my grandparents ' and they had a a big white house with a big front porch and , uh , banisters on it and a lot of rocking chairs out on the front porch . And it was just a great place to pretend and we would climb up on the porch and on the banisters and we could make those our horses or , uh , it could be a castle ; just do many things with it . Um , and when we were still living in High Point in our back yard we had a huge , I do n't know , I guess it was an oak tree , but it was a really big tree , but it was a climbable tree . And it had real large , thick branches extending out to the side and they were fat enough branches where as a child of eight and nine years old we could straddle the branches . And that was another game that Jill and I used to play ; we would pretend we were in the jungle and we would climb up on the tree and we would straddle the tree branches and pretend it was our elephant . And in the yard , we had an old tree that had been cut down and just the stump was remaining and my mother had planted , um , flowers all around that stump and we would use that stump as a , as a throne and the princess got to sit up on that stump on that throne and have all those flowers around her and that would be the throne and she would be the queen or the princess or whatever . When I was a teenager , an Audrey Hepburn movie came out called Wait Until Dark . And I think I was probably 16 or 17 years old ; we were of driving age . And I had a group of girlfriends that I ran around with and there were , golly , there might've been 8 to 10 of us who were good friends . Everybody had their own \" best \" friend but then we had one big group that we used to do a lot of things together . Um , and we would , had that many girls but we would only go out in a couple of cars and I remember one of the girls , Betty Belle , her dad had a VW Beetle , and we'd fit like 5 girls in that VW Beetle .",

So we went out one night to the movie , but before we went to the movie we went to get pizza and then we went to , and I think the name of the place was The Open Kitchen , and we did n't have chain pizza places like we do now , like Pizza Hut and all that . This was just a really neat pizza place that all the kids would go . And we went to Open Kitchen and we would have eight or 10 girls and we would order one pizza and all share it and everyone would only get one piece and I think we would make the waitresses mad because we did n't have money to leave tips . We would also drink water . So it was n't a good situation for the waitresses , but we had fun and we did n't even think about it . We just did what we could get away with . Anyway , that night we were gonna go see Wait Until Dark and I think it was on at the Manor Theatre , and I just remember when you have like 10 or so girls going somewhere to the same place it 's kind of a , pretty much of a spectacle ; we 're all in this long line and we 're giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time . So we bought our tickets and we went into the Manor Theatre and we found a row of seats and we sat , file , all filed in . And I just remember seeing , and I was sitting in a middle section , I was not on an end so I had girls I knew on both sides of me . And I just remember that movie was , had a lot of hype about being really scary and suspenseful and it 's nothing like these movies that are out today like Scream and , what is it ? Nightmare on Elm Street whatever it is , where they 're actual horror movies . This was , uh , a real intense , um , drama and , just very scary ; kept you on the edge of your seat . And there was a scene in the movie I remember where every one of us , and it was n't just our group , but so many people in the theatre , they screamed out at one time . And that 's really all I remember about that night , it was just a lot of fun . And I really hope that my daughters have had some nights like that and has had good times like that , that I can remember going out with good friends .",

        "text": "The elected president of the people of Venezuela , \" Hugo Chavez \" [ punctuation as published here and throughout ] , has once more taken up the reins of power at the presidential palace in Caracas . The rapid events and the changing of power in Venezuela indicate that the putschists did not enjoy a popular base and the Venezuelan people as well as the military in the country did not endorse the coup government of \" Pedro Carmona \" who was being supported by America . America was the only country that came to the support of the putschists immediately after they took power in Venezuela . Moreover , in its posturing with respect to this country , America declared that democracy had been victorious in Venezuela . America called the action of several military generals , who were supported by capitalist as well as bankers , as the victory of democracy in Venezuela under circumstances where Hugo Chavez had come to power in 1988 through a popular process . What is more , the promoting of a constitutional reform plan and carrying out of extensive economic reforms have led to his re-election in July 2000 as the president of Venezuela for a further six year term . A number of observers believe that the reasons behind America 's opposition to Chavez and its support for Venezuela under the generals who carried out the coup against him go back to the domestic and foreign plans and policies of Chavez . Following a series of domestic reforms , especially in the agriculture , energy and banking sectors and describing communism and capitalism as futile , Chavez caused the business leaders , bankers and capitalist to distance themselves from him and thus paved the way for their opposition to his power . The new laws were described by leaders of the economy as deviant and unfair and these leaders organised and stage - managed street demonstrations against Chavez with the help of the biggest trade and commercial unions as well as a sector of the army . Outside the borders of Venezuela , Chavez faced America 's hostility . This is something that the American officials have acknowledged on many occasions . They had been thinking about ways of ousting Chavez from the presidential palace in Caracas . Ever since he came to power , Chavez had refused to accept America 's biding and had called on Washington on numerous occasions to stop intervening in his country . He also accused America of killing innocent children and people during the Afghan war , met with \" Mo'ammar Qadhafi \" and \" Saddam Hoseyn \" , the presidents of Libya and Iraq and long - term enemies of Washington , and had a very close relationship with the Cuban leader \" Fidel Castro \" . The combination of Chavez 's performance and policies brought on the wrath of American President Bush to the extent that he failed to hide his anger during his visit to Peru . During his meetings with Peruvian officials , Bush spoke of America 's dislike of Chavez . Moreover , the American Secretary of State \" Powell \" also has recently announced in his annual report to the American Congress that taking into account Hugo Chavez 's closeness to countries that are not dependent on America , he is not considered to be a trustworthy pawn in the Latin American region . Powell had stressed that Venezuela is able to , as in the past , that is to say , the era of the military rule in that country , play an effective role in America 's policies in Latin America . Besides these instances of American hostility towards Chavez , mention must be made of his oil policy within OPEC . In recent years , Chavez caused OPEC oil policies to be strengthened in the face of the positions adopted by oil consumers . He has managed to a great extent to adopt policies aligned with other oil producing states whenever oil crises have emerged that led to reduced oil prices in the market . That is to say , he adopted positions where supply of oil by OPEC would be reduced and oil prices supported . This is while before Chavez , Venezuela used to be called the \" errant member \" within OPEC , a member that would follow less the concerted decisions of OPEC and observe less its own quotas . This is why one cannot dismiss the effects of the intensification of the Middle East crisis , Iraq 's initiative in using crude oil as a political weapon against Washington and the debate on an extensive oil embargo against the supporters of Israel on the events of the past few days in Venezuela as well as America 's support for the putschists there . America was trying to guarantee the flow of Venezuelan crude oil to itself by overthrowing Chavez and the seizing of power in the Venezuelan presidential palace by the dependent generals . The people of Venezuela thwarted America in this . Finally , America prescribes liberal democracy for others yet fails itself to accord any value to democratic principles in the world . The Bush administration 's support for the Venezuelan putschists is testament to this . Attachments : Image- 1.gif Image - 2.gif",

Talking to IRNA , Ivashev expressed regrets over the fact that the people in some parts of the world are indifferent toward the expansionist policies of the United States and do not proceed to condemn them . He strongly criticized the US war - mongering actions and tactics and said the US war - mongering has posed serious threats to the world . He said the United States has turned into an axis of evil itself and is ignoring even the resolutions issued by the United Nations . Ivashev further said Russia is to develop its relations with the Muslim nations as well as China and India . He said there are deep differences between Russia and the United Stats on a range of strategic , political and economic issues . He said the US officials claim as for the countries described as \" parts of an axis of evil \" are \" unfounded \" and the US claims in this connection are \" sheer lies \" . Reacting to the threats launched by the US president George W. Bush against Iran he condemned the United States expansionist policies . US President George W. Bush had in his State of the Union address termed Iran , Iraq and North Korea as \" axis of evil \" and accused them of attempting to develop weapons of mass destruction . Ivashev further said the United States is after gaining superiority over Russia 's nuclear capabilities and initiating an anti-missile defense system by the United States shows that country 's intentions . He said the United States is after imposing its expansionists policies under the pretext of the fight against terrorism .",

As a former board member , the success of the YMCA is still important to me . We must be able to reach all youth and families interested in values - based programs . The Invest in Youth campaign helps insure this . New initiatives in the inner-city are taking hold . The Urban Mission Branch is reaching out to middle school youth with programs based on caring , honesty , respect and responsibility for themselves and others . For some , these are very different messages from the ones heard in the street . They are learning to make positive choices concerning alcohol , tobacco and other drugs and to support each other when those choices are challenged . You have shared in the vision and the leadership of the YMCA of Greater Indianapolis . I now invite you to continue to support the mission and the message that is so important to building strong kids , strong families and strong communities . Please consider joining the Chairman 's Roundtable with a gift of $ 1,000 . I have enclosed a pledge card for your convenience . We would like to announce the success of this year 's campaign at the Annual Meeting on April 27 , so please return you pledge or gift within the next 30 days . Thank you . Sincerely , Richard H. Gilbert , Jr. Past Board Member YMCA of Greater Indianapolis",

Michael Sims felt that way at age 39 -- the day he earned a job . Michael was born with cerebral palsy . Upon entering the work force , he discovered few job opportunities that seemed to match his abilities . For several years he performed packaging and clerical work . His most recent job lasted only a year before cut - backs eliminated his position . For 18 long months Michael could not find a job . He resorted to public assistance dollars to survive . Finally , Michael called Goodwill . At Goodwill , Michael 's counselors felt that his personable demeanor could be a major attribute and identified for him a possible job - match where his people skills could shine . After three interviews , Michael proved that he was the right person for the job . As the Clubhouse Monitor at Bent Tree Apartments , he now provides customer service for 50 to 60 tenants each night . At last , he has found success in a job that he loves . Now his goals are set on moving up in the company . Every year , thousands of people come to Goodwill . Like Michael , they share two common characteristics . They face some barrier to employment and they want to work . With support from people like you , they can overcome their barriers and earn success and the self - sufficiency that comes with it . And then the pay - off begins for the entire community . Individual successes at Goodwill mean fewer persons receiving public support and more paying taxes . Last year , participants in Goodwill programs earned -- and paid taxes on -- wages of nearly $ 3.5 million . Their successes at work also saved taxpayers more than three - quarters of a million dollars in public assistance . The savings are counted in more ways than dollars and cents , however . The families of the new wage earners may feel the accomplishment in terms of a house to live in , money to purchase food -- without food stamps -- and the beginning of a family focused on success , not hopelessness . Wo n't you help make all of these successes possible ? Please send the largest contribution you can comfortably make . Your gift will help give new meaning to the word success -- for people who have seldom had reason to use the word . Sincerely , James M. McClelland President P.S. Your gift will make a difference . For every dollar of public support Goodwill received last year , we returned $ 1.59 to the community in the form of earned wages and reduced public assistance payments .",

The European Commission strongly welcomes this decision . By taking this decision , the EU has reaffirmed its commitment to pursuing multilateral solutions to issues of global concern . With its decision to ratify the protocol at EU level , the European Union stays true to its ambition to enable the Kyoto Protocol to come into force by the World Summit on Sustainable Development in August / September 2002 . The decision also makes the Member States ' greenhouse gas reduction commitments ( the so - called \" Burden - Sharing Agreement \" ) agreed in June 1998 legally binding . The EU continues to call for the United States to participate in the global framework for addressing climate change .",

Once again , the EU is exercising leadership in addressing this global environmental problem , as we have done in Bonn and Marrakech last year .

The man was caught by police while secretly slaughtering a cow at his farm . The meat was confiscated and will be tested to see if it is contaminated with \" mad cow \" disease , or bovine spongiform encephalopathy . Police stressed they had stepped up farm inspections across the region of Campania amid heightened concern over illegal slaughtering practices in the wake of Italy 's first suspected case of vCJD - the fatal brain - wasting human form of BSE . The case concerns a 23 - year - old woman from Menfi in southwest Sicily whom health officials said last week had almost certainly contracted the disease in Italy and at least five years ago . Federico Piccoli , a top neurologist at Palermo hospital who is helping to treat the woman , immediately warned that further cases of vCJD in Sicily were only to be expected because \" the illegal slaughter of animals still goes on here \" . His comments were immediately contested by meat industry representatives and vet associations but the opposition Green party said yesterday there was evidence that illegal slaughtering practices were on the rise in several southern regions such as Campania , Sicily and Puglia and that the meat was entering the food chain . Italy launched a BSE cattle - testing programme in January 2001 , in compliance with European Union regulations , and so far 56 cases of \" mad cow \" disease have been detected .",

Russian officials said the three men , including the world 's second space tourist South African millionaire Mark Shuttleworth , were in fine condition . Shuttleworth , 28 , who paid the Russians 20 m dollars for his jaunt in space , termed the experience \" extraordinary . \" He became the world 's second space tourist , after US businessman Denis Tito made a similar voyage a year ago . Vittori , 37 , spent eight months at Russia 's \" Star City \" in preparation for his 10 - day mission , dubbed Marco Polo by the Italian Space Agency . During his 8 days aboard the ISS he carried out a series of experiments for ISA [ as received ] and the European Space Agency on health in space Vittori , a colonel and test - pilot with a wife and two small boys , already has three years training at NASA centres in Houston . His training in Russia combined with his knowledge of American techniques will put him at an advantage if the role of station commander should open up in the future , he said before his training started . The role is currently reserved for Americans and Russians . Italy 's Umberto Guidoni was the first European to set foot on board the ISS in April 2000 , while a third Italian astronaut , Paolo Nespoli , is scheduled to make his trip in 2003 - 2004 . The estimated cost of Vittori 's flight with the Russians was around 12.5 m dollars . This covered his training , that of a Belgian substitute and the cost of carrying two scientific experiments on board the Russian Soyuz rocket .",

NSO statistics showed that the number of workers employed on a temporary and daily basis rose by 888,000 to 6,962,000 in October compared with late 1997 . The number working on a temporary basis went from 4,182,000 in late 1997 to 4,641,000 last month and that for those hired on a daily basis surged to 2,321,000 from 1,892,000 during the cited period . The number of full - time workers declined 626,000 to 6,525,000 during the same time span . \" Demand for those working on a temporary or daily basis is risiing because companies are trying to save labor costs amid the continued economic slowdown , \" an NSO official said . Over 90 percent of full - time workers receive retirement allowances and bonuses but the comparable numbers fell to 10 percent for temporary workers and 1 percent for those employed on a daily basis . About 80 to 90 percent of full - time workers were registered for the national pension , employment and health insurance systems while the comparable numbers shrank to 20 percent and 2 to 3 percent for temporary workers and those hired on a daily basis , respectively . hdh@yna.co.kr",

Making his point clear , he said that the former Soviet republics \" have not completely fallen apart , but have not formed a sufficiently strong alliance on a new basis either \" . He said , however , that a real unification will take place after all , since the CIS countries have far more reasons for a union that the European Union countries . He said this tendency reflects the economic and cultural traditions of the CIS countries which were formerly part of the Soviet Union . The current summit will hopefully allow the CIS countries to lay new ways towards rapprochement . Concerning the delimitation of the border between Kazakhstan and Russia , Nazarbayev said that this process is continuing without any disagreements and with mutual respect for each other 's interests , and that documents on the final delimitation are likely to be signed next year . Getting back to the problem of broadening all - round cooperation between the CIS countries , Nazarbayev said that a new factor - globalization - is accelerating this process . \" We cannot stand on the sidelines of this global tendency , \" the Kazakh president said .",

        "text": "Tehran , April 20 , IRNA -- President Mohammad Khatami on Friday evening congratulated the Venezuelan government and nation for the victory and restoration of the legitimate government of President Hugo Chavez after a failed military coup in that country . During a telephone conversation , President Khatami told his Venezuelan counterpart , President Hugo Chavex , that the return of the legitimate president and government to power was a victory of justice and freedom . The Iranian president also expressed the hope that with the return of President Chavez the Venezuelan government would be able to achieve its exalted objectives with the support of the people . Referring to the difficult period the venezuelan nation went through in the past week , President Chavez said the anti-democractic attempts to topple his government failed with the help of the Almighty God and the people . As to the re-establishment of legal order in his country , Chavez briefed the Iranian president on the latest developments in his country . Referring to the objective of those who were behind the military coup in Venezuela , Chavez said they wwanted to have Venezuela come out from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) and therefore tried to produce more oil in order to undermine the organization . President Chavez thanked President Khatami for his telephone call and wished success for the Iranian government and nation . The two presidents expressed a mutual desire to meet in the near future . Iran , Sunday last week , sent congratulations to Venezuela on hearing of the return of the rule of law and reinstatement of the legitimate government of President Chavez after the two - day military collapsed . On Saturday it condemned the the ouster of the democratically elected president of Venezuela , saying , \" resorting to a coup and the use of force is not an acceptable method to bring about political change and the method is not in conformity with the norms of present human society . \" Chavez was brought back to the Venezuelan presidential palace detained after the coup and thereafter resumed his functions as president . Chavez , whose mandate was due to end in 2006 , was forced out of office by the country 's armed forces who blamed him for the deaths of 15 people during demonstrations in the streets of central Caracas against an opposition protest which later became violent . Chavez is a staunch supporter of oil production cuts in order to boost prices in the world market . He initiated a successful Caracas OPEC summit in September 2000 , the second in the 40 - year existence of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries .",

With that in mind , Chatterbox hereby inaugurates the Intellectual Dishonesty ( henceforth to be known as the Indis ) Index . Here 's how it works : Publications that refuse to acknowledge ( even if to refute the importance of ) highly significant but inconvenient facts in their news or opinion coverage of controversial events will score one point for the initial offense . They will then score one point for every subsequent issue or broadcast or Internet posting after the first offense is noted by Chatterbox if they continue not to report said inconvenient fact -- and an additional two points on days when the news organization runs a follow - up without making note of said inconvenient fact . Publications receiving a score of 10 will be inducted into the Indis Hall of Fame . Publications that get all the way up to 20 will be faxed a likeness of Joseph Stalin . ( Chatterbox would prefer not to invoke the phrase \" intellectual dishonesty , \" because it 's pompous and falsely suggests that only intellectuals can be intellectually dishonest . But Chatterbox does n't know any other easily understandable phrase that describes this particular kind of offense . )",

In Europe , the council of environment ministers concluded a formal political agreement on 4 March on the decision to ratify the Kyoto Protocol before 1 June this year . With this major decision , the European Union is opening the door to the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol for climate protection just in time for the world summit on sustainable development to be held in August 2002 in Johannesburg . In the United States , on 14 February President Bush presented the US national climate protection program .",

The United States , the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases ( 25 percent of global emissions ) withdrew from an international agreement that , for the first time , set binding targets for developed countries for climate protection . We now know that the US withdrawal did not stop the world community from deepening this important multilateral agreement for combating climate change . The European Union played a dominant role in these negotiations and the community of states concluded , at the Bonn and Marrakech conferences of July and October last year , an agreement that sets out how to implement the Kyoto Protocol and provides for an original mechanism for respecting the reduction obligations that could possibly serve as a model for other agreements and that suggests a possible strengthening of international institutional structures in the environmental field . This must now be ratified by all the parties and will shortly enter into force . However , all the parties repeated with insistence that world climate protection cannot be effective unless the United States takes measures that are comparable to these taken by Europe and Japan .",

        "text": "Unfortunately , the recent US climate protection program falls far short of meeting such expectations . Although there is a certain satisfaction at seeing President Bush recognize the need to fight climate change , that must not in any way conceal the extreme weakness of what he announced . Under the US program , US emissions as a proportion of GDP must fall by 18 percent between 2002 and 2012 , or in other words energy efficiency must increase by 18 percent . This can hardly be described as ambitious as a 15 percent increase in energy efficiency was in any event expected given present productivity levels . In addition , if the US economy continues to grow , the increased energy efficiency will be cancelled out or more than cancelled out . With an annual economic growth objective of 3 percent , absolute US emissions in 2012 will be 24.5 percent more than 1990 levels , despite the improvement in energy efficiency . By comparison , respect for the Kyoto Protocol requires the EU to reduce its emissions by 8 percent compared with 1990 , Japan by 6 percent , and the United States by 7 percent , a figure accepted by President Clinton in 1997 .",

        "text": "Seoul , Feb. 18 ( Yonhap ) -- The government on Monday announced its position on U.S. President George W. Bush 's new policy to control greenhouse gas emissions that he wants discussed internationally along with the Kyoto Protocol , an international treaty adopted in 1997 to control greenhouse gas emissions . The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in a statement that \" the Government of the Republic of Korea appreciates continued interest shown by the Government of the United States in climate change and their efforts in presenting on February 14 a new initiative to address this issue which is one of the greatest challenges humankind faces in the 21st century . \" The statement was issued by the name of Foreign Minister Choi Sung - hong . \" The Korean Government notes that the new U.S. Government initiative adopts a flexible and gradual approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions , and that it takes into consideration the concerns of developing countries , \" the statement said . The ! Korean government is of the view that in order for the U.S. initiative to be discussed in more detail in future international fora , greater elaboration is needed , including concrete methods to establish the levels of greenhouse gas intensity , it continued . Parties to the Climate Change Convention have been preparing for the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol since the adoption of its implementation rules last November in Marrakesh , Morocco . \" In light of this , the Korean Government believes that consultations amongst the international community are needed to build understanding on the U.S. initiative , \" the statement noted , adding the Seoul government will actively participate in this process . Over 180 countries , including the United States , have prepared for ratification of the Kyoto Protocol , a framework that requires signatories to gradually reduce greenhouse gas emissions . The U.S. administration led by President George W. Bush rejected the Protocol early last year and recently announced a new policy on climate change which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to Gross Domestic Product or economic activities . Before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the United States , the Bush administration had been severely blamed in the international community for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol . Meanwhile , some other countries , including Japan and Germany , already issued statements on Bush 's new climate change policy in rather different tones . yct9423@yna.co.kr",

Mr. Stoiber seized it once the CDU made clear that it preferred him to its own chairwoman . That has always been the basic premise for a CSU chairman to accept the candidacy on behalf of the bigger sister party .

The most cogent argument in Mr. Stoiber 's favor is that he will be running as a hopeful and not as the ticket of last resort . The CDU chose him because it believes in victory . The government is floundering , more seriously than anyone would have thought six months ago . The Union parties could not have wished for a better situation from which to launch their campaign .

We 've found ways for people with disabilities to enter the workforce . We 've expanded Goodwill 's proven methods to towns and neighborhoods where they are needed most . Of course , we 've played different roles . You have helped make Goodwill 's work possible with your previous support . Goodwill has devised the programs that turned your investment into results . Who has benefited from our partnership ? Everyone has . When you and I help somebody find a job , one more person joins the ranks of tax payers , fewer tax dollars are spent on public assistance and businesses gain another consumer . There are a lot of barriers that keep people from working : physical and mental disabilities , history of welfare dependency and lack of education or self - esteem . And there are a lot of people who face these challenges every day of their lives . So our work must continue . Everyone benefits from the work we do together . Many people need our help . Please continue our important partnership . Support Goodwill with a generous donation today . Sincerely , James M. McClelland President",

        "text": "November 15 , 1996 Dear Personal Donor : In the short while since Goodwill helped him find his job , Robert has learned to thoroughly clean a motel room in about 40 minutes . His job objectives call for him to do it in 30 . He has no time to waste . Neither do we . With the help of friends like you , Goodwill has continued to adapt our services to meet the human needs of our changing society . We do n't waste time as we are helping the community . And we do n't waste money . The gift that I am asking you to make will be used to continue our mission of helping people prepare for , find and keep jobs . In their December , 1995 review of the nation 's best charities , U.S. News & World Report called Goodwill one of the five \" Standout Good Guys . \" The magazine stated that Goodwill ( as well as the other standouts ) is \" uniquely effective , innovative or valuable . \" While I appreciate U.S. News & World Report 's endorsement , the true value of your support is measured by the way Goodwill takes on problems that affect all of us . Every time we help someone find a solution to their employment barrier , the positive effects radiate throughout our community : The business community welcomes not only another worker , but a consumer with increased purchasing power . Parents act as role models of self - sufficiency instead of dependency . Tax dollars that would have been spent on public assistance are saved . You and I know that solutions to difficult problems do n't just happen . At Goodwill , it is the hard work of staff and those who benefit from our services that produces the kind of inspiring results I see every day : A Goodwill staff member addresses a group of welfare recipients : \" You can earn the money to support yourself and your family , \" she says . \" You can get off welfare . I know you can ... I did . \" A participant in a Goodwill program rushes back from a job interview to share the results with his classmates in our desktop publishing training program . once his tears have subsided , he confirms what his classmates have already figured out : he just received a job offer -- his first in five years . Addressing a meeting at a neighborhood center , a Goodwill staff member tells the audience how Goodwill can help them find and keep jobs . On his way home , he shares the story with four people at a street corner . At the next corner he tells five more . In order to develop job skills , a man with some serious disabilities begins working in Goodwill 's industrial division . It takes a long time for him to gain the self - confidence to work elsewhere in the community . Eventually , he turns your support into a payoff for all of us . He proudly leaves Goodwill to support himself . These people and their successes are real . Just like the respect we 've earned from U.S. News & World Report . Just like the impact Goodwill 's work has on our community . Real work . Real results . A real difference in people 's lives -- in all of our lives . The people who can benefit most directly from your generosity have no time to waste . Neither do the rest of us who feel the positive results of their success . Your support helps provide real solutions . Please use the enclosed response card and envelope to give generously to Goodwill today . Sincerely ,",

This is the time of year when we give thanks for the warmth and love that surrounds us . And this time of year is an occasion to remember those not as fortunate as we are . Pleasant Run cares for at - risk children and families . We do this through a wide range of programs including community - based , therapeutic foster care , group homes and our treatment center . Many of the children are victims of abuse or live in unstable homes . Today we are asking you to take a few minutes to consider making a contribution to Pleasant Run to help the 1,500 children families we care for . Many of the children have no homes ; no memories of joy from past holidays . Others are from families that are struggling to provide a healthy , happy environment but do n't have the resources to make it possible . Your contribution will make a difference in a child 's life . It may help a family stay together . It can certainly make happy holiday memories . A gift to Pleasant Run means the children in our care will have presents to open . A gift means a family will have a holiday meal , cooking utensils to prepare the meal and dishes to serve it on . Your gift will go beyond the holiday season . It can help purchase clothing , school supplies , books and educational tools throughout the year .",

Over the past three years , 15 Koreans were murdered , 177 were assaulted , 95 kidnapped or illegally confined , and 64 robbed , the Korean Embassy in Beijing said Saturday . The figures are feared to be higher since many cases were not reported , an embassy official said . The most frequent crimes involved the loss or theft of Korean passports , according to the official . Last year alone , 1,800 Korean passports were reported missing in China -- 1,000 in Shenyang , Liaoning Province , 400 in Beijing and 200 in Shanghai , the official said . Missing passports find their way to human traffickers , he said .",

        "text": "Chapter 5 A Physics of Semantics ? ach of the chapters of Investigations broaches new territory . Each is tentative and incomplete , pointing but not fully adequate . Yet , I persistently hope , it is better to light one candle against . . . what ? the darkness ? the veil beyond which we have had no framework of questions before ? There are grounds , reasoned about by the best of philosophers and scientists of the past several centuries , to doubt a physics of semantics . We are on shaky ground . Yet when the first hard frost comes , when the birches have been swung , their crimson leaves scattered carelessly , when crystals splint shallow ponds and old egrets stand dark watch the coming dawn , long - legged , knowing how winter is thin , when the first phase transition of water to ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams , small creatures of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where , perhaps , something new is to be found . We have lacked a physical definition of an autonomous agent , able to manipulate the universe on its own behalf the egret whose foreboding of winter leads to lifted wing and steady , powerful flight . The egret is as much a part of physical reality as the atom , and perhaps more than the vaunted quark . But autonomous agents , we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf , we to whom ``intentionality '' and ``purpose '' are so inevitably attributed by our common languages , we are , by my definition of autonomous agents , also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties . If the concept of autonomous agents were something like a useful or more , a proper definition of life itself , then autonomous agents span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where ``purpose '' is ascribed by all of us to one another . Semantics enters with purpose . For this to be true , it is not necessary that the carriers of purpose , say , the same bacterium heading upstream in the glucose gradient , be conscious . I hope my definition of an autonomous agent is useful , an autocatalytic system carrying out a work cycle , now rather broadened by the realization that autonomous agents also do often detect and measure and record displacements of external systems from equilibrium that can be used to extract work , then do extract work , propagating work and constraint construction , from their environment . Know - how Bring ourselves empathetically and objectively back three billion years to the mixed microbial community flourishing right about where most of us are now , plus or minus a modicum of layers of surface crustal material . I want to say that the autonomous agents comprising that community had , individually and collectively , the embodied know - how to get on with making a living in the natural games that constituted their world . Indeed , as I have emphasized before , a biosphere is a self - consistent coconstruction of autonomous agents , ways of making a living , and the search procedures , mutation , recombination , as well as behavioral search open to autonomous agents . Those means of making a living that were well searched out and mastered by the agents and their search procedures became the kinds of ``jobs '' that were widely filled , the abundant niches of the bio - sphere . There is in this whole self - constructing system a wider know - how , beyond the know - how of any single autonomous agent spinning eagerly in its microenvironment . Yet , clearly , the know - how is distributed . There is no autonomous agent , no one , who knows how the whole system works , any more than anyone at present knows how the global economic system works in its myriad interactions , deals , steals , hopes , and frustrations . What in the world is ` `know - how '' ? Philosophers distinguish between ` `know - how ' ' and ``know that . '' I know how to tie my shoes and am learning how to play jazz drums . ` ` Know that '' concerns propositions , most conveniently , human propositions . I know that the moon is they tell me not made of green cheese . I know that the earth circles the sun , that the earth is roughly spherical , that chairs are used to sit on . ` `Know that '' brings with it the standard and nonstandard issues of the truth or falseness of propositions as they report states of the world . Perhaps higher primates who are trained to manipulate simple symbols with apparent reference to the world also can ``know that '' with respect to propositions . Unlike ``know that , '' ` `know - how ' ' does not involve propositions about the world . ` ` Know - how '' involves procedural knowledge about how to get on in the world . The cheetah streaking after the wildebeest , the athletic genius high jumping , have the know - how to do it . Does a bacterium know how to make a living in its world ? I certainly want to say yes , without attributing consciousness in any way . Watch the myriad subtle turnings on and o of genes , metabolic switching , mechanical twitching , sensing of glucose gradient , swimming and tumbling upstream to higher glucose concentrations . It knows how all right , even if it cannot talk about how it gets on with its business . But then , try to talk about tying your shoes or the skilled driving when you become aware some dozens of miles down the road that you have accomplished the tasks without paying the slightest focused attention . Thank God for know - how . Know that is a thin veneer on a four - billion - year - old know - how skill abundant in the biosphere . But any autonomous agent proliferating alone or in a congery of other agents , it would seem , is also graced by the selfsame know - how . If we synthesize autonomous agents in the next decades and they coevolve under our rapt gaze over months or years into a modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life forms , they too will know how to make a living in their mutually created world plus the boundary conditions we more or less intelligently impose on them . The know - how is , in these terms , nothing but another view of the propagating closures of catalysis , work tasks , sensing , recording , and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous agents . The know - how is not outside that propagating organization . The know - how is the propagating organization . Semantics All of which brings us , inevitably , to the brink of semantics . It is simple at its roots , you see . An incoming molecular species arriving in the interior of an autonomous agent really is ( i ) food ; ( ii ) poison ; ( iii ) a signal ; ( iv ) neutral ; ( v ) something else . Once there is an autonomous agent , there is a semantics from its privileged point of view . The incoming molecule is ``yuck '' or ``yum . '' I think the major conceptual step to yuck or yum is unavoidable once there is an autonomous agent . And I think we have roughly the Darwinian criteria in mind . If yum , then there will probably be more of this type of agent , osprings of the first . If yuck , it is not so likely this lineage will prosper . Once yuck and yum , we are not far from C. S. Pierce ' s meaning - laden semiotic triad : sign , signified , significans . Like it or not , the glucose gradient is a sign , a predictor , of ``more glucose that way . '' Granted , the glucose is not an arbitrary symbol , any more than a cloud is an arbitrary symbol of rain . In this restricted sense , signs are causally correlated with that which is signified . By contrast , the relation between the word ``chair ' ' and that which it signifies , and on which I am now sitting , is arbitrary . But can chemical signals in bacterial and plant and human communities be arbitrary from a chemical causal point of view ? If so , can ``mere chemicals '' be signs in the full Piercean sense ? I believe it is clear that mere chemistry in an autonomous agent can harbor symbols and signs in the full senses of the words . Consider first the famous genetic code . Triplets of nucleotides in an RNA molecule stand for specific amino acids that will end up incorporated into a protein . The detailed causal machinery involves transfer RNA molecules with their anticodon site and the distant site to which amino acids are attached , the aminoacyle transferase enzymes that charge the amino acid binding site of each transfer RNA with the proper amino acid among the twenty amino acids , the binding of the charged transfer RNA ' s anticodon site to the proper RNA code word triplet , the ribosome that glides between adjacent charged transfer RNA molecules and links the successive amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain that hangs free in the cytoplasm , tethered by the ribosome to the messenger RNA molecule as it is ``translated . '' The arbitrariness of the genetic code is exemplified by the evolution of novel transfer RNA molecules , which translate a given messenger RNA code word triplet into a dierent amino acid . As J. Monod properly emphasized three decades ago in a slightly dierent context concerning activation and inhibition of enzymes at allosteric sites on the enzyme that are distant from the catalytic site , the relation of chemical structures that achieve control of catalysis are utterly arbitrary with respect to the chemical structures that undergo the catalysis . The same is true of the transfer RNA where the anticodon site is distant from the amino acid binding site . Because of this , which amino acid is charged onto a particular transfer RNA is utterly arbitrary and controlled by the aminoacyle transferase enzyme that does the charging , plus the structure of the amino acid binding site on the transfer RNA . Both of these can be altered without altering the anticodon - codon matching mechanism . In short , chemistry allows arbitrary organizations of control relations . It seems fully legitimate to assign the concepts of sign , signified , and significans to the genetic code . It seems legitimate to extend that notion to much of the subtle signaling , chemical and otherwise , within and between autonomous agents , as exemplified by plants that upon infestation by a particular insect secrete a secondary metabolite chemical that ``warns '' other members of the same species that an insect infestation is happening and to turn on defensive anti-insect secondary metabolites . The calculus that is Claude Shannon ' s elegant information theory has always been about reduction of uncertainty about the statistics of the source of a set of symbols . Nowhere in the core of Shannon ' s work concerning the encoding and transmission of information does the meaning , or semantics , of the information enter . This is no criticism , and is widely known and appreciated . There is , however , just a hint of semantics in Shannon ' s view that the semantics resides in the ``decoder . '' I cannot buy Shannon ' s view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent . If not , then the decoder merely transforms a bit string sent along a communication channel into some other discrete or continuous dynamics perhaps a set of water - filled bowls is drained by turning on a machine that opens valves between the bowls and to the outside world in particular ways . The patterns of bowl drainage upon receipt of the binary string messages sent along the communication channel constitutes the decoding . But if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbol - sign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner , that sequence of events seems laden with semantics . If only the bacterium could tell us : ``Did you see that truck of a paramecium coming at me ? I' ve run into that one before ! I ducked under a boulder , and he never sensed me . I made it home . Pass me some more glucose please , Martha . '' I will return in the next chapter to discuss such stories , for I will say that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and , therefore , cannot deduce that which will unfold . Thus , among other things , we must tell stories to understand the oriented actions of agents in their worlds . Do not be overly quick to accuse me of anthropomorphizing . I too know the risks , including the common claim that we can always in principle translate from ``intentional talk '' to the fully predictive causal account of the events in question . But patience . Not only are we unable to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and predict what will unfold , but we also cannot even translate in the sense of necessary and sucient conditions from legal talk to normal intentional talk , let alone from legal talk of Henderson found guilty of murder to a physical talk about sound - wave forms monitored and masses at space - time lines as a description . Then let ' s just be naive for the moment . The semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous agent say , an early bacterium is somehow linked with the embodied know - how of that agent in making a living , or failing to make a living , in its world . The semantics of an event is some subset of the fully embroidered , context - dependent set of causal implications of the event , or signal , in question . `` For want of a nail , the shoe was lost ; for want of the shoe , the horse was lost ; and for want of the horse , the rider was lost , '' more or less , said Benjamin Franklin . The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered context - dependent set of implications of the event , or signal , in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving system . It seems hard to ascribe purpose , in the sense of acting on its own behalf , to a stone or a chair and easy with respect to an alga . Of course , there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous agents is purely tautological . After all , I began by stating that a bacterium swimming upstream in the glucose gradient was acting on its own behalf in an environment , defined an autonomous agent as a physical system able to act on its own behalf , then asked what a physical system must be such that it can act on its own behalf . Now , five chapters later , it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous agents are the proposed organization of matter , energy , and organization to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf . My definition is a definitional circle . On the other hand , while the definition is circular , like F = MA and Darwin ' s ``natural selection ' ' and ``fitness , '' that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world . Stones and chairs are not , by my definition , autonomous agents . All living cells are . And the stunning fact directly before us , every day , is that autonomous agents do manipulate the world on their own behalf . Watch a pair of nesting birds build their nest . In short , once we have autonomous agents and yuck and yum , it appears that semantics enters the universe as the agents coevolve and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of a biosphere . Knowing What about ``knowing '' ? Daniel Dennett , in his fine book Darwin ' s Dangerous Idea , advances a hierarchy of forms of ``knowing , '' if I may use that term , that have arisen in evolution by Darwinian means . I find his hierarchy congenial and informative . Dennett envisions evolution as a sequence of kinds of construction cranes that bit by bit build up higher - order entities via variation and natural selection . I do not disagree , although I have placed far greater emphasis on the roles of self - organization in evolution . Here , in Investigations , I am trying to point at the mysterious but utterly natural hopefulness in which an increasing diversity of broken symmetries in the universe creates the diversity of structures and processes that can constitute and identify ramified and ramifying sources of energy , detect those sources of energy , create devices and processes that couple to those sources of energy , and generate yet more diversity that propagates macroscopic order even further . I wonder , in short , at the naturalness and self - generaticity of Dennett ' s cranes building cranes building cranes in biospheres , perhaps planetary geologies , and beyond . But back to the past . Dennett distinguishes ``Darwinian creatures , '' ``Pavlovian creatures , '' ` `Popperian creatures , '' and ``Gregorian creatures . ' ' A simple autonomous agent , say , a bacterium , is a Darwinian creature . In its simplest version , the creature evolves by mutation , also recombination and natural selection . For the moment , no behavioral learning is to be considered . So one ( or a colony or an ecosystem ) of Darwinian creatures adapts more or less as Darwin told us . At the next level up , say , aplysia , a nervous system is present , and the creature is capable of stimulus - response learning , a la Pavlov . Indeed , aplysia can learn very simple conditioned stimuli the later analogue is the bell causing the dog to salivate in ``expectation ' ' of food . At the next level ( Dennett , perhaps properly , reserves this for us vertebrates ) is the Popperian creature . Popperian creatures , in Dennett ' s fine phrase , have ``internal models '' of their world and can ``run the internal model ' ' with the clutch disengaged , rather than running the model in real time in the real world . This allows us lucky Popperian creatures to allow our ``hypotheses to die in our stead . '' I love that image . Beyond the Popperian is the Gregorian creature namely , at least humans . Dennett makes the wonderful argument that we utilize our tools literally stone knives , arrows , digging sticks , machine tools to enlarge our shared world of facts and processes . This enlarged shared world gives us more know - how , and more know that . Cultural evolution , at some point , begins to burst out - of - bounds . Hard rock music jangles the minarets of Iran . Who knows what new cultural forms will blossom ? Chinese cooking lands in Cuba , and Cuban - Chinese cuisine is invented . What ' s next under the sun ? Who can say ? I very much like Dennett ' s ladder of know - how , and eventual know that . Without invoking consciousness , not because it is not worth invoking but because so little sensible has ever been said on the subject , it seems worth asking how much of this hierarchy could be realized by simple molecular systems , even without evoking nerve cells . I would think a lot of this hierarchy could find molecular realizations . For example , bacteria and amoebae do have a kind of Pavlovian learning already , for they have receptors that accommodate to a constant level of a given signal ligand and sense instead a change from the current level . This is not yet the association of a more or less arbitrary conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus , but I can imagine chemistry to accomplish the latter . As neurons are supposed to proliferate and form novel synaptic connections that survive if used and to mediate the linkage of conditioned to unconditioned stimulus , why not envision a complex chemistry , say , very complex carbohydrate - synthesis patterns sustained by complex sets of enzymes whose activities are modulated by the dierent carbohydrates themselves , which is true of contemporary carbohydrate metabolism . Such a system might blindly try out variant patterns of synthesis until it could establish a self - sustaining web linking the carbohydrates , the enzymes , and certain protein receptors mediating the linkage between unconditioned and conditioned stimulus , then maintain that linkage by positive feedback loops . The image is not too far from how it is imagined that ``idiotype '' and ``anti-idiotype '' immune networks work to sustain synthesis of a set of desired antibodies against an incoming pathogen . In such networks , for which there is modestly good evidence , a given first antibody serves as an antigen that stimulates the body to produce a second antibody that binds to the unique amino acid sequences , called the ``idiotype ' ' of the first antibody . In turn , the second ``anti-idiotype '' antibody stimulates a third , which stimulates a fourth . But this series is likely to form feedback loops because the first and third antibody can often both bind to the same site on the second antibody , hence , the first and third antibodies are similar shapes in shape space . It is not much of a stretch to think of the immune system as a conditioned stimulus response system . Popperian creatures ? Why cannot the molecular - sensing and hypothesis - testing churning concerns of the bacterium as it senses a paramecium churn twenty cycles before kicking in the rotary motor , or not , such that the wee bacterium hides under a boulder of a grain of sand until the beast passes by ? Are nerves necessary ? Plants , as noted , are said to signal one another with complex secondary metabolites to characterize the particular kinds of insects infesting the glade . There are arbitrary structural relations between the metabolite and the insect , just as symbols in human language are often arbitrary with respect to the signified . Not bad for nerveless nonvertebrates . I do get stuck at Gregorian creatures . Even here , the free and open creating of new symbol strings in a language , wherever new sentences can be created , is not that fundamentally dierent from the persistent open creation of new kinds of molecules in the biosphere as a whole . If the conversation we recent two - legged ones are having with respect to our digging sticks and atomic bombs is impressive , so too is the chemical conversation in any full - fledged ecosystem , where we are all instrumental in the lives of one another . I suppose I am naively driven to consider that the biosphere , with its urgent diversity in which , emboldened by all our know - how , we do get on with a very rich conversation , may very early already have harbored all the levels of which Dennett speaks . We humans are just more gregarious with our vocal cords and e-mail , I guess . Smart place , a biosphere , lots to talk about . Four billion years of yammering . Slapstick comedy may have started a long time ago . Ethics And what of ethics ? Does a whi of ethical issue arise with autonomous agents ? Yuck or yum from my point of view if I am an autonomous agent . There are deep reasons for caution . Hume told us long ago about the ``naturalistic fallacy '' : One cannot deduce ``ought '' from ``is . '' From the fact that mothers care for their young , we cannot deduce that they ought to do so , Hume argued . From the fact that Hitler set out to conquer Europe and more and to kill Jewry , we cannot deduce that he ought to have done so . Indeed , Hume ' s injunction underlies the caution of scientists about making ethical statements . We scientists find the facts . You citizens across the globe can argue the ethics . But if Hume warns us not to deduce ought from is , where do values come from at all ? Hume ' s injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless began by recognizing the legitimacy of the category ``ought . '' The eorts following Hume to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long , twisted , arduous . Following the dictates of the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle that only those statements capable of verification were meaningful , philosophers as famous as G. E . Moore came to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances . `` It is wrong to kill . '' Becomes , ` `Agggah ! '' Does the positivist argument seem persuasive ? It has always amused me that the core injunction of the logical positivists , ``only those statements that are empirically verifiable are meaningful , '' is itself not empirically verifiable . One is reminded of something about hoisting and petards . John Rawls of Harvard has argued eloquently that our human notions of fairness derive from what we would all ``contractually '' agree to , were we to know before birth that we would all be born with diering abilities and endowments . Thus ``equality before the law '' is one contract that Rawls commends to us . ` `Equality before the law '' is far more refined than the yuck or yum of the bacterium . The emergence of ethics in the evolution of life on this planet is a fascinating issue . I will content myself with wondering where ``value '' and the rudiments of ``intentionality '' come from in the physical universe in the first place and leave social contracts for other eorts . Where is the place of value in a world of fact ? So , a short soliloquy . Facts are know - that statements . But know - how preceded know that . While fully aware of Hume ' s injunction , I think that from the autonomous agent ' s perspective , yuck or yum is primary , unavoidable , and of the deepest importance to that agent . I suppose we apply the Darwinian criteria . Too much yuck , this one and its progeny are gone from the future of the biosphere . Without attributing consciousness to an E. coli , or an autonomous agent we may create in the near future , I can not help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous agents are around . And again without attributing consciousness , once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present ? If so , another cornerstone of ethical activity has been laid . Ethical behavior requires first the logical possibility of behavior for which one is responsible . You are not responsible for acts and eects beyond your control . To act ethically , you must first be able to act at all . But what are ``acts '' in the first place ? Daniel Yamins is a brilliant young mathematician . Now entering Harvard , Dan spent a summer with me at the Santa Fe Institute before he learned to drive , after an earlier summer spent in the laboratory of Jack Szostak at Harvard , where , at age fourteen , Dan was learning to evolve RNA molecules to bind arbitrary ligands . Dan and I struggled that summer to make the distinction between the ``doings '' of an autonomous agent and mere happenings in and around the autonomous agent . Note we say the E. coli is swimming upstream in the glucose gradient to get dinner . But all sorts of molecular vibrational , rotational , and translational motions are occurring . What are actions and what are mere happenings ? I do not think we were successful in drawing a clean distinction between doings and happenings with clear mathematics . But I sense that the distinction between doings and happenings , Dan ' s happy phrasing , is relevant for E. coli , tigers , us , trees , and autonomous agents in general . We will meet a similar problem in the next chapter when we attempt to distinguish between the function of a part of an organism and the other causal consequences of that part of the organism . Strange and interesting , is it not , that these issues all seem to arise with autonomous agents but not otherwise ? Granted that we here seem to confront the language game circularity alluded to earlier , yet I do truly think that the rudiments of semantics , intentionality , value , and ethics arise with autonomous agents . I do not think those rudiments suce to jump over Hume ' s naturalistic fallacy . We cannot deduce ought from is in any concrete context , but I think we have the categories of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous agents .",

That 's where the Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis come in . We reach out to kids -- especially those from disadvantaged neighborhoods where the risks are highest . We give them a chance to realize their own potential by giving them a place where they can develop a sense of competence , of usefulness , a sense of belonging and of influence . To accomplish this , the five area Boys & Girls Clubs of Indianapolis must be open and available when the kids need them , with the staff and programs the kids need to reach and grow into responsible and caring citizens . This costs money . Money for programs , for equipment , and for repairs and improvements to club facilities . Your contribution last year of helped us get where we are today . We are counting on you now to help us get where we need to be tomorrow . Would you please consider a gift of the same in 1999 ? Please , give generously . The kids are depending on you . Respectfully , James Campbell President of the Board Deputy Chief , Indianapolis Police Department A United Way Agency Please detach and return in the enclosed envelope .",

When young people do n't have that support , they need other resources for encouragement to guide them along the way . Big Sisters helps bridge that gap by providing children with the resources they need -- Big Sisters volunteers . Big Sisters are mentors and friends who empower girls to more fully reach their potential , experience life 's opportunities and perhaps begin to dream . The relationships that are formed provide strong foundations from which healthy values and strong self - confidence can grow , helping youth become strong , independent adults of tomorrow . This year we will serve over 1,000 girls through our mentoring programs . This is an impressive number ; but for each girl served , more are left unserved . Over 150 girls are currently waiting for a Big Sister . You can make an impact by supporting Big Sisters Annual Campaign and our $ 200,000 goal . If you are a regular contributor to the Annual Campaign , I encourage you to consider increasing your gift by 10 % . If you have not supported Big Sisters in the past , please join me in doing so by completing and returning the enclosed pledge form . Early adolescence is the most vulnerable age for youth . But caring adults like you can reach out and help . It 's the perfect time to make a world of difference . Sincerely ,",

We 've worked hard to structrue the organization so that we 've ready to move boldly into the next century , and I believe that we have an exciting and successful future ahead of us . One of the areas we 've decided to focus on is development . It 's clear that if we do n't increase our base of private funding , we wo n't have the kind of control we need to ensure the continued success of our centers and the very important services they offer . In 1998 , CCI served 31,484 individuals right in their own backyards . Where else would that many people turn if CCI were n't there to help ? The community initiatives committee is working with our development office to put together a long - range fundraising plan that will ultimately bring more money into our centers . This in turn will help us to increase and even improve the services we offer . With this in mind , I am asking each one of you to make a personal contribution of $ 50 , $ 100 or even $ 1,000 to show that you believe in the work that we do and are willing to support it with both your time and your finances . This way when we go out to ask for community support and are asked about our board giving level , we can show our in - house commitment through 100 % board participation . I also encourage you to seek additional support through your company , church , or service organization . I know that our staff and committee members will be happy to go with you to talk to these group if you need their help . We 're at an exciting juncture and it wo n't be long until we start seeing solid results from our efforts . Your financial support of the development process is just one step in making CCI a stronger , more efficient and ultimately more effective federation of service providers . Please , make your contribution today . Sincerely , J. Chris Graffeo Chair P.S. If you have any questions , feel free to call Valery De Long at CCI , 638-3360 x23 .",

Do not sit this one out . Do not play it safe . Understand the world and change it where it needs to be changed ... Make our society better . Make a world worthy of the children that your generation will bear . \" -- Carl Sagan You can help make positive changes in the lives of at - risk youth in central Indiana . We often hear about economic poverty , but what some of these young people are growing up with is emotional poverty - they have often given up on hope and the possibility of a successful future . With your help , we can change that . Many Little Sisters are preparing to go back to school this fall full of hope and with a positive outlook . Thanks to our Big Sisters volunteers , these young people are self - confident , believe in themselves and are beginning to realize their full potential . A recent study bypositive Public / Private Ventures ( PPV ) showed that girls who had a Big Sister for just one year : reduced first - time drug use by 46 % lowered school absenteeism by 52 % cut violent behavior by 33 % enhanced school performance showed improved peer and family relationships Former Little Sister Amy , now 18 - years old , is a testament to the Big Sisters program . \" I was matched with my Big Sister in June of 1992 . Since then , she and I have grown very close and I have been able to experience lots of new things . We go to movies , dinner , concerts , and other stuff like that , but I have also been able to participate in charity events and fundraiser type things . Not only did I have a lot of fun with my Big Sister , but I learned a lot from her too . I have become more open - minded , more responsible , and , most importantly , I have gained a lot more self - confidence . I am very thankful to the Big Sisters program for allowing me this very special opportunity . In 1998 , Big Sisters served 972 young people through its many programs . But the need is still great . Over 170 young people are still waiting for a mentor . You are an important part in making sure these young people are matched with caring adult mentors . Will you make a financial gift to Big Sisters in 1999 that will ensure that more young people receive the guidance they need , that more young people stay in school , stay off drugs and make good choices ? Your contribution will be used to recruit and retain quality volunteers . It will also be used to help maintain the infrastructure that fosters and supports the development of effective relationships , including volunteer orientation and training and ongoing supervision and support by a professional staff . This year your gift can go farther ! Gifts of $ 100 or more will be matched thanks to a special 25th Anniversary $ 100,000 Challenge Grant and will be placed in the Growth For Girls Fund . This fund will support the goal of having 550 mentoring relationships by the end of 1999 and 1,200 by the end of 2004 . If you would like to find out more about the Big Sisters program , please call us , ( 317 ) 634-6102 and ask for Ellen Robinson . Thank you very much for your time , attention and consideration . Sincerely , Andrew T. Burns Patron Relations Chairperson P.S. When you give to Big Sisters , you can get 50 % back ! For a minimum contribution of $ 250 , you become eligible for a 50 % Indiana state tax credit through the Indiana Department of Commerce Neighborhood Assistance Program ( NAP ) . A limited number of credits are available . To receive an application form , check the NAP box on the enclosed pledge card or call us , ( 317 ) 634-6102 , ext. 20 .",

        "text": "November 27 , 1995 Dear Friend : What kind of people benefit by your contribution to Pleasant Run Children 's Homes ? Little ones , like Baby Jessica , caught in the struggle between adoptive and birth parents . Older kids , like Tracy and Kerry , left homeless after a recent murder - suicide in Indianapolis claimed Mom and Dad . Young adults , like Mary T. , a jobless mother of three , trying desperately to keep her kids out of trouble in a crime - ridden neighborhood . Real people ! There are thousands more . Families are being torn apart , and too often , children are the victims . Kids like Tommie J. , made a ward of the court because of repeated beatings by an alcoholic father ; Alice , sent to a group home to get help because of severe behavior disorders ; and John H. , a recovering alcoholic , rebuilding a relationships with his family so they can live together again . Pleasant Run Children 's Homes began serving children nearly 130 years ago . Then the task was to help children who lost parents in the Civil War . Today , we serve children and families with a multitude of problems : emotional , physical , psychological and sexual abuse . Some come from families where , through therapy , there is hope for reunification . For others , \" families \" are the counselors are housemates at the group homes where they live . The biggest tragedy is that the problems do n't go away ; they only grow . In 1994 Pleasant Run served 346 children and 125 families . In 1995 we will serve over 850 children and 340 families . In 1996 , these figures will triple . The children and families who come to Pleasant Run are given the opportunity to become happy , loving , and productive members of our society . They welcome the chance to belong , to become self - sufficient , to regain their self - esteem and confidence . Often it is a long , hard struggle , but the results are well worth it . For Pleasant Run to continue to serve abused and neglected children and their families , we need your support . The Funding sources are shrinking , but the needs grow explosively . Please \" help good kids get better \" by sending us a contribution today . Your gift will give children and families hope for improved tomorrows . Sincerely , Mary Roth",

Her , let 's see , her mother 's family were wealthy people at one time . They owned car dealerships and extensive land . Um , I do n't know if they were farmers or not , but I know they were land owners , um , many acres and , um , her grandmother was raised in wealth . Uh , then the Depression came and apparently everyone lost all their money . Um , she was raised in MO , and she married a man , this is my grandmother I 'm talking about . And they were very poor by this point , and they had , I think , seven children . And one particular Christmas , things were very , very difficult . There was no money to buy any presents at all , um , for the children , and my grandfather , who was killed when my mother was 16 , this was , of course , way before that , um , he must have been a very positive person because what he did with the situation was he , he told the children that there were no presents this Christmas because they had given them all to Santa to take the poor children and this made the children feel happy and proud of themselves and it gave them a good feeling that they had done something very nice for someone less fortunate than themselves . Um , I felt like that was a way to face that situation with such hope and with joy and with love . And although I never met my grandfather , I have never forgotten that story and when I hear of him I think what a wonderful , wonderful person he must have been .",

I hope you 'll consider continuing your support of Jameson 's special campers by renewing your last gift of $ xxx . I can tell you we need your help now as much as ever before . All of our Six summer camping sessions are booked to capacity ( and , truth be told , with maybe one our two extra returning campers squeezed in ) and we have a waiting list of 60 children who are hoping to come if a spot should open . Many more camper referrals are coming from new organizations such as school social - workers and family counseling agencies . It seems summer options are n't readily available for troubled kids whose families have limited incomes , so we 're doing all we can to make Jameson available . That \" we \" includes the Youth Leadership teens . These 60 or so campers have takenon a fund raiser with a goal of raising $ 16,000 for camperships . Two of them told me yesterday that as a group they decided they had to earn the right to ask others for help by accomplishing something real to help themselves . And that 's from kids many people see as a problem . Even after the summer sessions come to a close , Jameson campers will take part in year - round programs designed to keep that positive contact with peers and role models alive and important . We 've scheduled more than 15 follow - up camper weekends beginning in September and going around till next summers camping season . Please , consider renewing your support of these great kids today . Sincerely , Julie Marsh Executive Director P.S. We know our follow - up weekends are going to be better attended than ever this fall and winter . If you can give a little more to help meet this increased expense we would appreciate your support .",

        "text": "Tehran , Oct 21 , IRNA -- Visiting Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez here Sunday underscored the need for coordinated efforts among members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) to keep oil prices at a ' fair ' level . Speaking at a meeting with his Iranian counterpart President Mohammad Khatami , Chavez recalled the looming recession in world oil markets following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the U.S. , and remarked that cooperation among OPEC member states , particularly the Islamic Republic is a must to secure their interests . He further called on non-OPEC oil producers to cooperate with the organization to alleviate existing concerns over falling oil prices . President Khatami , for his part , highlighted a collective quest by OPEC member states to stabilize oil prices at a reasonable level . He reiterated OPEC 's concern to ensure the interests of producers and consumers , and pledged for cooperation among the members of the organization to protect producers ' interests and bring price stability to world oil markets . Elsewhere in his remarks , Khatami lashed out at the recent US - led attacks on Afghanistan , and voiced Iran 's displeasure with developments in the war - ravaged country . He reiterated the need to set up a coalition government in Afghanistan comprising all Afghan groups to reinforce stability . Khatami and Chavez agreed that ' Dialogue Among Civilizations ' could serve to mitigate clashes of civilizations and would also ensure a durable peace . Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez whose country holds the rotating chairmanship of OPEC arrived at Tehran Sunday from Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , for talks with President Khatami on oil related issues . He is scheduled to leave Tehran Sunday evening for Moscow to follow up his deliberations on the same subject with Russia as one of the most important non-OPEC oil producing countries . The Venezuelan president has been embarked on a tour of several European and African countries including Austria , Libya and Algeria in his efforts to garner support to prop up oil prices .

The young adults who leave Pleasant Run have those same feelings . Very few have family support to get them started . Many need furniture , linens and other basic necessities to begin lives on their own . To help them establish themselves in the community , the Pleasant Run Emancipation fund was begun in 1993 by private donors who wanted to provide a measure of financial support for those leaving our programs . Individuals who are being emancipated are eligible to receive up to $ 500 from the Fund if they formally apply and meet four requirements : 1 . Release by the courts 2 . Successful completion of all life skills tests 3 . Positive termination of his or her Pleasant Run program 4 . Possession of a high school diploma or GED Proof of meeting these , two staff reference letters and an essay stating why they should receive a grant and how it will be used are all reviewed by a Pleasant Run panel , which determines if the applicant merits the funds . Such fund are often used for college tuition , vocational training or a deposit on an apartment . Because Pleasant Run is the only \" family \" for so many , our Emancipation Fund is one way we can help a young person take the first steps into his or her new life as an independent and productive adult . Without private donor support , this Fund does n't exist . Please take a few minutes to send a donation to help one or more of our children successfully cross that threshold into the future . Sincerely , Mary Roth Executive Director",

The authorities were able to confirm via information provided by the U.S. military that the trawler exchanged messages with the North before it was intercepted by patrol boats off the Japanese island of Amami Oshima . The U.S. forces stationed in Japan provided video information of the vessel after detecting it via a military reconnaissance satellite on Dec. 18 . The following day , Japanese defense officials were able to determine that the trawler was using the North Korean Workers ' Party radio frequency . An antisubmarine patrol aircraft was dispatched to the scene and located the vessel Saturday , three days after the authorities had received the information from the United States . Although the defense officials declined to give details of the messages exchanged between the vessel and the North Korean side , they said , \" The ship may have been involved with the smuggling of drugs used to treat drug addicts . \" The newspaper added that the Japanese government , which first believed the vessel was a North Korean spy ship based on its shape and equipment , have gained more evidence to support their suspicions . yct9423@yna.co.kr",

This diminishes -- slightly -- the significance of Norma Kelsey 's possible motives in verifying parts of Broaddrick 's story . ( One of the three is Kelsey 's sister , whose motives can be similarly questioned ; the other two heard Broaddrick tell her story but did not see her bruised lip , as only Kelsey and Broaddrick 's husband claim to have . ) However , Chatterbox notes that NBC , like every other responsible news organization that 's covered this story , reported that Norma Kelsey 's father 's killer was pardoned by Gov. Bill Clinton , and remains perplexed that the Journal editorial page won't . Its Indis Index is today up to seven .",

Jan 8 ( Interfax - AVN ) - Two citizens of Iraq were detained on the Russian border on Monday when they attempted to cross into the country illegally from Azerbaijan , a spokesman for the North Caucasus regional border guard department told Interfax - Military News Agency . The two detainees aged 26 were taken to a picket of the Derbent border guard detachment for a probe into the incident . Servicemen of the Sochi border guard department protecting a section of the Russian - Georgian frontier apprehended another violator on Monday , the spokesman said . A 33 - year - old citizen of Romania tried to enter Russia illegally from Georgia 's breakaway region of Abkhazia .

The Nizhny Zaramag checkpoint on the Russian - Georgian border is closed temporarily . The Verkhny Lars checkpoint is operating , but the number of people using it is very small .

During his visits to some OPEC member states in 2000 , he also paid a visit to Baghdad ; meanwhile , he has all along maintained a close relationship with Cuba . All these are eyesores to the United States . As for Bustani , he hoped that Baghdad could become a member of the OPCW so that the United Nations could conduct arms inspections in the country . To the United States , what Bustani wanted to do was even more intolerable , as it would disrupt the US plan of launching a military strike against Iraq .",

Criticisms of Chavez 's governance have been widespread in the democratic world , above all in the past year , in which he has taken to visiting dictators like Castro or Saddam Husayn and writing to terrorists like the famous Carlos , instead of meeting his promises of prosperity and fair shares . Debatable decisions of his have caused a deep social polarization and brought him into confrontation with representative sectors of civil society , against which he used more demagogy than arguments . But the latest events reveal that his popularity had not collapsed . The coup misjudged its strength and Carmona remaining in power could have led to a serious division of the armed forces . This possibility and the proliferation of expressions of support for the overthrown leader among the military officers made a change of course advisable , with the forced resignation of Carmona and the even more meteoric period in office of Chavez 's vice - president , Diosdado Cabello , who only took up the post in order to give his leader time to reappear . All of this leaves in the air a feeling of military uncertainty , after a two - way trip in 24 hours which will undoubtedly leave deep wounds in armed forces which clearly have not given up their wish to exert a decisive influence in political life . The civilian opposition , which in the absence of political parties was organized around the employers ' organization and the trade unions , does not come out of it well either . But President Chavez too is seriously damaged by his links to the groups of armed followers who left a score of dead in Thursday 's ! [ 1 ! 1 April ] crushing of the demonstrations . The today revived president will have to tackle the future with different methods . It is time for the former officer to rethink , to set priorities , to understand that the Cuban model no longer works even for Havana , to give up , as he has promised , revanchism and to understand that Venezuela is a Western country where there is no reason for it to be impossible to improve the fate of the Venezuelans and eradicate the eternal scourge of corruption , within a framework comparable to that of the rest of the world . All of which , incidentally , is something of which Chavez has done very little so far .",

[ second announcer ] In a rare development , which reminds one of the American - backed coup d'etat by General Pinochet against the legally - elected President of Chile , Salvador Allende , in 1973 , the legally - elected President of Venezuela , Hugo Chavez , was ousted as a result of coordinated operations carried out by a number of army generals , as well as prominent industrialists , capitalists and forces acting as American agents . Venezuela is one of the largest oil producers and exporters in the world . It has vast natural resources and riches . However , despite the passage of 170 years since its independence , it is one of the poorest countries in the world . More than 80 per cent of its population live below the poverty line . Indeed , that is the fate of many Latin and South American countries which have been living for decades under American - backed military regimes that oppressed their own peoples . [ passage omitted : On developments in Venezuela after World War II ] As a result of developments in the 1990s , Hugo Chavez was elected in the free elections held in 1998 . He gained the votes of the vast majority of voters and immediately declared that the aim of his government was to eliminate poverty and injustice and guarantee the independence of his country in the face of foreign interference . Chavez 's policies were aimed at eliminating injustice and poverty in his country . Thus he introduced reforms in the economic and commercial arenas , as well as in the oil [ industry ] . As a result , industrialists and prominent capitalists , as well as defeated political forces acting as foreign agents and the military figures associated with them , became concerned about the situation . Gradually , this led to the formation of a coalition . Indeed , the officials of the Chavez government repeatedly said that foreign intelligence agencies were involved in the formation of that coalition . As far as the issue of foreign policy was concerned , Chavez sought to preserve the independence of his country in the face of American pressure . He pursued an independent policy . One of the main objectives of his policies was to properly utilize Venezuela 's vast natural riches , namely oil . In this way , he sought to implement his policy of eliminating poverty . Moreover , Chavez 's foreign policies were contrary to American interests in Latin America , as well as in other parts of the world . In Latin and South America , Hugo Chavez established close and friendly relations with Cuban President Fidel Castro and invited him to visit his country . He also supported movements that opposed American intervention in the region , thereby infuriating Washington . That was particularly because his policies enjoyed widespread support among regional countries . Washington was concerned that the Chavez model might affect other [ Latin ] American countries . Moreover , America also openly opposed Chavez 's policies of establishing friendly relations with certain countries that pursued independent regional and international policies . Nevertheless , the most important reason for America 's concern was the issue of oil . This issue is closely intertwined with America 's policies towards the Middle East . Following Iran 's proposal on cutting off the supply of oil to countries that support Israel for one month , which was supported by some oil - exporting countries , there was an increasing probability that Venezuela would also support [ the proposal ] . Therefore , the ouster of the Chavez government was an effective solution . It also served the interests of the forces that opposed Chavez inside [ Venezuela ] . Therefore , it seems that the coup d'etat in Venezuela should be assessed as a plot that was hatched for that purpose .",

        "text": "Seoul , Nov. 19 ( Yonhap ) -- The recent settlement of details regarding the Kyoto Protocol is putting local exporters on alert . The Kyoto Protocol was made by members of the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change at its seventh session held in Marrakech , Morocco at the start of the month . If the protocol , which prescribes an obligatory reduction of greenhouse gases , is put into effect , the nation 's export will be heavily damaged . The Kyoto Protocol is an agreement to get 30 leading industrialized countries such as Japan and members of the European Union ( EU ) to lessen greenhouse gas emissions by amounts as high as 95 percent of levels in the 1990's . The government and business circle expect the nation 's exports to be damaged in direct and indirect ways from 2008 , when advanced nations will begin to be regulated by the protocol . The reason is that South Korea 's industrial structure depends heavily on the export of products including not only durable appliances such as air conditioner but also automobiles all of which should meet intensified environmental standards before they can be shipped overseas under the Protocol . Also , advanced nations are likely to make use of the standards as a new trade barrier . Moreover , the pressures from advanced countries to get South Korea to cut its greenhouse gas emissions is expected to strengthen . South Korea ranked ninth on a list of the largest greenhouse gas producers , and Korea 's per-capita emissions were also close to those of advanced countries . Under this situation , the nation cannot possibly avoid pressures to match the cuts of advanced nations . In particular , Japan and European countries are likely to persuade developing countries including South Korea to take part in the reduction of greenhouse gases earlier than planned in an attempt to secure the United States ' ratification of the protocol . The U.S. backed out of the agreement , saying its industries would be handicapped by stringent rules that developing countries could simply ignore . Even though South Korea declared its intention to discuss its duty to cut down greenhouse gases from 2018 , there is little possibility that advanced nations will wait until then . If things go on like this , the government must transform the current industrial structure into an environment - friendly one and minimize industries which use a host of energy such as petrochemicals and cement manufacturing . The government will have to pour a lot of money into businesses to promote energy efficiency . According to an April survey of 416 firms across the country conducted by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( KCCI ) , 60 percent of total respondents said the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change will greatly influence local firms But only 28.4 percent replied that they are rushing to conform to the protocol 's requirements . \" The government should provide domestic firms real aid like tax reductions and environmental technology development rather than abstractly recommend domestic firms promote energy efficiency and lower energy consumption , \" an industry source said . Unless measures that comply with the Kyoto Protocol are mapped out early , the nation 's competitiveness in manufacturing sectors will weaken soon . sunglok@yna.co.kr",

An understanding that , above anything else , success requires genuine effort , a willingness to set challenging goals . Caring about others . These are the attributes we want all children to have . You help Jameson campers reach for them . If these special children are to become the adults we all need them to be , we have to lead them in the right direction right now . Jameson points the way for children who need that extra hand and I hope you 'll continue your support this year . You 're last gift of $ 50.00 helped make it possible for us to provide guidance , encouragement and fun to nearly 400 Indianapolis area children . And not just during the summer , but throughout the year . What has your support of our campers meant to them and what have they been able to accomplish because you care ? The best indicator I can give you of the positive effect our year - round contact has is the growth in and deeds of the Youth Leadership teens . In just the past few years this program has grown from a few kids and a few extra activities to a team of almost 60 young adults taking on real projects . YL teens will make J.C. juniors happen again this year for 7 and 8 year old campers . A five day camp , J.C. juniors introduces at - risk children to Jameson two years earlier than we could previously reach them . That means we now have the opportunity to be a stable , positive and important part of each child 's life for an entire decade . The teens have also decided to raise money to provide camperships for other campers because they know what Jameson has meant to them . And their activities are n't isolated to Jameson . The teens have undertaken a volunteer project to regularly visit with sick children at a local hospital . Please consider renewing your gift today . The kids need your leadership now more than ever . If you can increase your last donation , we would appreciate that show of support for the campers and their efforts to overcome obstacles and create successful lives . Thank you again for helping point the way . Sincerely , Julie Marsh , Executive Director P.S. You make it possible for us to help special kids with learning disabilities , behavior problems and economic disadvantages to gain the confidence required to put genuine effort into achieving real goals . I hope you 'll continue -- and if possible increase - your support for these great kids .",

The whiff of scandal and conspiracy is in the air -- and the American media , ever addicted to conspiracy theories , is not going to let it go .

This is one of the provisions of the federal programme Energy - Efficient Economy that covers the period from 2002 to 2005 and sets guidelines until 2010 , the Government Information Department reported on Tuesday [ 27 November ] . The programme calls for the overhaul of nuclear power stations with a view to extending their safe and efficient operation , extending the service life of power units , resumption of the construction of power units and compiling a list of promising sites for future nuclear power stations . Its other provisions include the overhaul and construction of new plants for making fuel elements and the overhaul of \" wet \" nuclear waste storage facilities . In the next stage , 2006 - 2010 , the efficiency of existing nuclear power stations will be stepped up by increasing the utilization of current capacity , extending their service life and increasing capacity by using new - generation power units In 2005 , the capacity of all Russian nuclear power stations should total 25.24 GW . It will increase by 3 GW in 2002 - 05 and by 4.81 GW in 2006 - 10 to 30.05 GW . When nuclear power stations account for nearly 20 per cent of total energy generated in the country , nearly 52bn cubic metres of gas will be saved in 2005 and 65.5 bn cubic metres in 2010 . The construction of nuclear power stations in Iran , China , India , Kazakhstan and Ukraine will provide 42bn dollars in 2002 - 2005 and 24bn dollars in 2006 - 2010 .",

We help people train for and find jobs that make it possible for them to get off of welfare . Last year , Goodwill placed 511 people in jobs , more than double the number we placed in 1993 . While the debate on welfare reform is gathering like a storm at sea , the people who need jobs are floundering . We need your support to continue getting people off of public assistance .

The third is the perception of the President as an incapable leader , which is already happening , and the fourth is that Venezuelans are able to find a substitute leader . The first factor deals with the nation 's general mood . Venezuelans ' level of optimism is currently the same reported in 1998 ; that is , they are feeling pessimistic . The difference is back then , Chavez ' candidacy raised expectations . This lasted two years and people are feeling pessimistic again . To the president 's misfortune , 80 percent of Venezuelans believe there is a solution for the unemployment problem . As Christiansen explains , ' if Venezuelans did not see unemployment as a problem that could be solved , they would not blame it on Chavez ' incapacity . Four of every 10 Venezuelans are blaming this problem on him . ' As for the second factor , 43 percent find nothing positive in the government 's actions . Chavez ' strengths include his personal qualities ( 27 percent ) and clear desire to work ( 17 percent ) . In other words , Christiansen points out these are the strengths of a campaigning candidate instead of a president with three years in office . The fact that two - thirds of Venezuelans consider Chavez responsible for the country 's problems shows that he is losing strength in the third aspect of stability : The President 's ability to keep hope is shrinking . Finally , the Consultores 21 analyst notes that today , the number of extreme Chavez opponents ( 42 percent ) is larger than that of extreme Chavez supporters ( 18 percent ) , which could bring about a confrontation for power . He added that Chavez still leads voter 's preference with 28 percent . \" ]",

        "text": "Islamabad , March 6 , IRNA -- Leading Pakistani defense analyst Hameed Gul on Wednesday rejected this year 's US State Department report on human rights , saying it was \" a pack of blatant lies and propaganda . \" A former director - general of the Pakistani Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , Hameed Gul told IRNA in an interview here that each country which resisted American hegemony was deemed a violator of human rights . \" In a fit of force , the US wanted to subjugate the entire world community and was not ready to tolerate any hurdle in this direction and the recent report on human rights was also a manifestation of its hegemonistic designs , \" the lieutenant general ( retd ) continued . Hameed Gul was of the opinion that the US was the only country in the world that had no respect for any religion , faith , norms , decency , human rights and rules . \" It is unprecedented in the history of the comity of nations that the US forcibly wanted to prevent countries from upholding religious and cultural values , \" he said . \" The US is the most fraudulent , terrorist and extremist country . The world would never forget the barbarities it committed on the innocent Afghan people , women , children and the elderly , \" he firmly said . In order to realize its vested interests in the region , he said the US and its allies unleashed oppression against the Afghan people and used latest weaponry against the defenseless nation . In this regard , he made a quick reference to the ongoing killings of Indian Muslims . \" Since the rioting erupted last week , over 600 people , mostly Muslims , have been brutally murdered in the hands of extremist Hindus in India , but the US and other so - called civilized nations kept a shameful mum , \" he remarked . The Americans , he pointed out , see violations of human rights when a country or a group of people become hurdles in the realization of their vested interests . \" What Israel is doing in Palestine against the Muslims is also one of the worst examples of rights abuses but the US is again silent , but when Palestinians react to Israeli attacks America is quick to The logical solution to the Palestinian issue is a free and independent state for the people of Palestine as enshrined under UN resolutions , he said . But the US is denying this , he added . He said it clearly means that the Muslims have no right to defend themsleves against their oppressors . \" America wants total submission of Muslims across the globe , \" Hameed Gul said . \" The situation requires a concerted moral resistance by Muslims scholars ; if they remain indifferent to each other 's plight in the hands of imperialist forces led by the US , they would be crushed one by one , \" he warned . Muslims rulers should forge unity in their ranks to resist the ever - increasing US influence ; otherwise , they would be targeted one by one , Hameed Gul concluded .",

        "text": "October 7 , 1996 Name Address City , ST Zip Dear Name : In the summer of 1993 , the Marion County Commission on Youth began what can best be described as a \" new era \" in its history . MCCOY was reorganized as an independent , not - for - profit agency , separate from local government . It retained , however , the same mission with which it had been charged from its inception : to serve as a catalyst for effective , coordinated , and collaborative service delivery to youth in our community . For the past three years , MCCOY has been actively engaged in accomplishing this declared mission in cooperation with many others : youth service providers , youth , funding bodies , and interested citizens to name a few . We have met with a number of successes along the way , most notably the Summer Fun Line , the Metro Summer Bus Pass , and the development of ten neighborhood youth councils . A Providers Council and a Youth Coalition are building relationships that will hopefully bear great fruit in the years to come . The formation of The Community Academy , a pilot project directed at expelled students from local school systems , has come about as a result of MCCOY 's efforts to mobilize community agencies in response to a pressing issue . McCoy is actively represented and working with numerous community collaborations where we regularly raise our voice to speak out for the inclusion of young people in both decision - making and program planning processes . One concrete example is a joint project undertaken in the United Northwest Area in partnership with The Junior League of Indianapolis and Community Partnerships with Youth from Fort Wayne , Indiana . As a team , these three organizations are working with neighborhood youth and adults to build a \" Caring Neighborhood with Youth \" , mobilizing the assets of young people and adults as partners to build a better neighborhood for all . Since its re-organization , MCCOY has established its unique niche within the community by refraining from direct service programming and focusing on what it does best : helping to identify youth needs , convening groups of individuals and organizations which can address those needs , and moving toward collaborative solutions . McCoy has only one interest : the well being of Marion County 's young people . McCoy invites the support of The __ Company Foundation in the amount of $ 10,000.00 to support such activities as : ---- the co-ordination of youth leadership training and youth empowerment efforts at the neighborhood level by means of neighborhood - based youth councils ; ---- the promotion of youth employment opportunities ; ---- the facilitation of ongoing discussions regarding effective and efficient youth service delivery ; ---- the provision of technical assistance and guidance to neighborhoods which seek positive youth - adult relationships ; ---- the development of community - wide supports for the positive growth of all Marion County young people . In the last several years , the business and corporate community has recognized that the positive development of youth is directly related to the development of a competent workforce .

        "text": "A Brief History Jerusalem ' s recorded history begins with its mention in Egyptian court records 4,000 years ago , but there had been human settlements here for centuries , probably millennia , before that . At the beginning of the second millennium b.c. , Jerusalem was a Canaanite mountain stronghold on a secondary trade route , far less important than biblical cities such as Hazor , Megiddo , Beth Shean , and Shechem . The earliest name associated with the city , Ur usalim , perhaps meant ``city of Shalim ' ' or ``founded by Shalim . '' Scholars speculate that Shalim might have been an ancient Semitic deity of peace , for the name resembles the modern Hebrew and Arabic words for ``peace '' : shalom and salaam , respectively . If true , this is an ironic name for a city that would become one of the most constantly and bitterly embattled places on the face of the earth . Biblical Jerusalem In the Bible , Genesis 14:18 -- 20 records that Abraham visited the city of ``Salem ' ' in approximately 1800 b.c. and was blessed by the city ' s ruler , Melchzedik , who offered him bread and wine . The city is not mentioned again in the Bible until the time of the great poet warrior , King David , who captured the city from the Jebusites in about 1000 b.c . The Bible describes how David ' s soldiers conquered Jerusalem by discovering a water tunnel under the walls and using it to take the city by surprise . Warren ' s Shaft , part of a Canaanite water system discovered by 19th - century archaeologists and open to visitors , might be the very tunnel infiltrated by David ' s army . Perhaps because Jerusalem was in neutral territory not allotted to any of the twelve rival tribes of Israel , David made it the capital of his newly formed kingdom and brought the most talented artisans , dedicated priests , magical poets and musicians , and the most formidable soldiers from each of the tribes to live in his city . He also brought the Ark of the Covenant , the portable tabernacle containing the Tablets of the Law received on Mount Sinai , to the Spring of Gihon , just outside the walls of Jerusalem . There the Ark rested until it was placed in the Temple , built in approximately 960 b.c. on Mt. Moriah , the high point at the northern end of the city . The Temple ( today known as the ``First ' ' Temple ) was completed by David ' s son and successor , King Solomon . According to biblical tradition , although David bought the land for the Temple and carefully assembled its building materials , he was deemed unworthy of constructing the Temple because he was a man of war with blood on his hands . At the Temple ' s dedication , Solomon addressed his God : `` ... the Heavens , even the Heaven of the Heavens , cannot contain Thee ; how much less this House that I have built ? '' The site of the Temple eventually became identified as Mt. Moriah , on which it stood , where Abraham was called to sacrifice his son Isaac . Along with this splendid house of worship , Solomon built a royal palace , mansions for his wives , temples for the foreign gods worshipped by the princesses he had married , and towers for the defense of the capital . Under the wise reign of Solomon , the city flourished as the capital of an empire that stretched from Damascus to the Red Sea and controlled the trade routes from Egypt to Phoenicia . The Temple and royal palace were adorned with gold and ivory from Africa and with cedar from Lebanon ; the beauties and glories of Jerusalem under Solomon have captivated readers of the Bible for almost 3,000 years . But with his death the empire collapsed , and the Israelite kingdom was divided into two separate , impoverished , often warring nations : Israel , with its capital at Shechem in the north , ruled by a series of northern dynasties ; and the smaller kingdom of Judah , with its capital at Jerusalem , from which the Davidic dynasty continued to rule . The Bible tells us that the cruelty and impiety of the rulers of both kingdoms aroused the fury of the great Prophets . In 701 b.c. the Assyrian armies of Sennacherib destroyed Israel and moved southward to besiege Jerusalem . Thanks to King Hezekiah ' s hidden water tunnel , the city narrowly escaped destruction . The end of David ' s dynasty came in 587 b.c. , when Nebuchadnezzar , King of Babylon , invaded Judah to lay siege to Jerusalem . When it fell , the Temple and all the buildings were burned . The people of the once - glorious city were forced into an exile known as ``the Babylonian Captivity . '' In time , the kingdom of Babylon was overthrown and the Israelites were permitted to return to Jerusalem in 539 b.c . The city was now under the more tolerant rule of the Persians , but rebuilding was slow work . The Second Temple was finished in 515 b.c. , but much of the city still lay in ruins . Jerusalem submitted peaceably to the rule of the Greeks in 332 b.c. under Alexander the Great and , subsequently , to his Hellenistic successors as well as the Egyptian Ptolomeys and the Syrian Seleucids . When Seleucid rulers outlawed Judaism , Jews led by Judah Maccabee and his brothers staged a revolution in 167 b.c. and , against all odds , restored the primacy of Jewish religious life in Jerusalem . The Macabbees cleansed the Temple of Hellenistic idols and the blood of pagan sacrifices ; the eight - day celebration of Hanukkah ( Feast of Dedication ) commemorates their victory . The Hasmonean dynasty , descendants of the Maccabee family , ruled an independent Jewish Commonwealth that stretched from the Negev to the Galilee . Jerusalem grew , surrounded with a formidable wall and defended by towers beside the Jaffa Gate . The Hasmoneans ruled until Pompey ' s Roman legions arrived in 63 b.c. Roman Jerusalem After the initial years of Roman administration and political infighting , Rome installed Herod ( scion of a family from Idumea , a Jewish kingdom in the desert ) as King of Judea . He reigned from 37 to 4 b.c. , during which time he fortified the Hasmonean wall and rebuilt the defense towers beside Jaffa Gate , the foundation of which still stand . Several palaces were built and a water system installed . Herod also completely rebuilt the Temple , making it one of the most important religious centers in the Roman Empire . The courtyard around the Temple was expanded to accommodate hundreds of thousands of pilgrims , and the Temple Mount was shored up by retaining walls made with great stone blocks . One of these walls , the Western Wall , is today a major reminder of Jerusalem ' s greatness under Herod . A massive fortress was built overlooking the Temple Mount , which Herod named ``Antonia ' ' in honor of his Roman friend and benefactor , Mark Antony . For all his accomplishments , Herod was nevertheless hated by his subjects ; he taxed , he tortured , and he ordered the massacre of male Jewish infants in an attempt to do away with the heralded Messiah . When Jesus was born in about 4 b.c. , Joseph and Mary escaped Herod ' s paranoia by fleeing into Egypt with the new - born infant . They returned to live in the Galilee village of Nazareth , making pilgrimages to Jerusalem . According to biblical accounts , Jesus spent his life ministering in the Galilee Valley . In about a.d. 30 he and his followers went for Passover to Jerusalem , which was in unrest at this time , dissatisfied with Roman domination . Jesus ' s entry into the Temple caused a commotion ; after the Passover dinner he was arrested by the temple priests , who were under direct Roman rule . Jesus was put on trial quickly and condemned to crucifixion , a Roman form of execution for political and religious dissidents as well as for common criminals . In a province rife with rebellion and retaliation , the execution in Jerusalem of yet another religious leader from the Galilee did not by itself have an immediate effect on history . After Jesus ' s crucifixion , harsh Roman rule continued until a.d. 66 , when the Jews rebelled . For four years Jewish zealots fought against the might of Rome . At the end , the Roman general Titus laid siege to Jerusalem in a.d. 70 , finally attacking its starved and weakened defenders . Those who didn ' t escape were executed or sold into slavery . The Holy City and the Temple were destroyed . The last of the zealots held out for another three years at Masada ( see page 76 ) . Half a million civilians died in the Galilee and Judea as a result of this first revolt against Rome , a number unequaled in ancient warfare . Christian and Islamic Jerusalem For 60 years Jerusalem lay in ruins , until the Roman Emperor Hadrian ordered the city rebuilt as a Roman town dedicated to Jupiter . In outrage , the Jews began a second revolt against Rome , led by Simon bar Kochba . The ruins of Jerusalem were briefly liberated , but , in the end , Jewish resistance to Rome was defeated with great loss of life . The planned new Roman city , Aelia Capitolina , was built over the ruins of Herodian Jerusalem , and Jews were barred from residing there for all time . Jerusalem ' s physical existence as a spiritual city seemed finished , but its spiritual power for Jews , and for the struggling new Christian religion , remained . For the next two centuries Aelia Capitolina enjoyed an innocuous history . But the Roman Empire became Christian in the fourth century , and Jerusalem became a center of religion once again . Queen Helena , a devout Christian and the mother of Emperor Constantine the Great , made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 326 to identify the sites associated with Jesus ' s life . She found that the city ' s most beautiful Roman temple , dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite , stood on the site of the crucifixion . The temple was demolished and a vast , Classical - style church was built around Golgotha ( the hill where Jesus ' s crucifixion was believed to have taken place ) . Throughout Jerusalem , other spots important to Jesus ' s life were commemorated with religious structures . Pilgrims came from all over the Roman ( and , later , Byzantine ) Empire during the following centuries , but the prosperity they brought lasted only until 614 , when Persian armies overtook Judea and reduced Jerusalem to rubble again . In 629 , Jerusalem was recaptured by the Byzantines . Still reeling from the effects of the Persian devastation , Jerusalem was conquered in 638 by the forces of Islam . The Temple Mount was identified in Islamic tradition as ``the farthest spot '' ( in Arabic , el - aksa ) , the site to which the Prophet Muhammad was transported in one night from Mecca on a winged horse , as described in the 17th chapter of the Koran . From here the Prophet ascended to the heavens and was permitted to glimpse paradise . The rock on the Temple Mount from which he ascended , at or close to the site of the ruined Temple , was commemorated by the construction of the Dome of the Rock in 691 . The Dome of the Rock remains Jerusalem ' s most striking monument ; it is counted among the most beautiful buildings ever created . By about 715 , the El - Aksa Mosque , third holiest place of prayer in Islam ( after Mecca and Medina ) , had been built on the southern side of the Temple Mount . Jerusalem continued under Islamic rule for the next four and a half centuries . In 1099 , under their leaders Godfrey de Bouillon and Tancred , the Crusaders captured the Holy City for Christendom by slaughtering both Muslims and Jews . Crusaders , Mamelukes , and Turks The Crusaders established a feudal Christian state with Godfrey at its head . They built many impressive churches during the term of the first Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem , but in 1187 they were driven out by Muslim forces under the great warrior Saladin . During the Sixth Crusade ( 1228 -- 1229 ) , the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II managed to secure Jerusalem for the Christians by negotiation . The Christians , however , could not hold the city . After they lost Jerusalem , a Mongol invasion swept through , and in 1244 the Mameluke dynasty of Egypt took control , ruling Jerusalem for the next 250 years . The city struggled to rebuild from Crusader wars and invasions . Much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was constructed in the Mameluke era , but the past thousand years had taken their toll : Jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had enjoyed in earlier times . In the early 16th century , the Ottoman Turkish Empire was advancing through the Middle East . Jerusalem fell to the Ottomans in 1517 , remaining under their control for 400 years . Suleiman the Magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this day . Fountains , inns , religious schools , and barracks were constructed . But when Suleiman died , his empire , including Jerusalem , began a long period of decline . The Holy City remained a backwater until the 19th century , when renewed interest among Christian pilgrims made it the destination of thousands of travelers each year . 19th - Century Aspirations At the same time , many Jews sought religious freedom and fulfillment by moving to Palestine ( as the Holy Land was traditionally called ) and especially to Jerusalem . In the 1890s , Theodor Herzl ( 1860 -- 1904 ) worked to organize a movement , Zionism , to create a Jewish state . Chaim Weizmann ( 1874 -- 1952 ) , a scientist born in Russia but later a British subject , did much to put Herzl ' s hopes into practice . Weizmann was an important figure in the negotiations with the British government that led to the Balfour Declaration of 1917 , supporting the idea of a Jewish ``national home ' ' in Palestine that also respected the rights of existing non-Jewish people already living there . The problem was that British strategists , who were fighting the Ottoman Turks in 1917 , had secretly promised the lands to their World War I Arab allies . In 1922 the League of Nations granted the British a mandate to administer Palestine . Jerusalem flourished during the early years of the Mandate . Modern neighborhoods , hospitals , schools , and the Hebrew University were built in West Jerusalem , the new Jewish enclave . But Arab opposition to new Jewish immigration and construction in Palestine led to increasing strife ; by 1946 , Jerusalem was an armed camp . In 1947 the United Nations voted for the partition of Palestine into two states , one Jewish and one Arab , with Jerusalem as an international city that belonged to neither . But lacking the means to enforce its decision , the United Nations was powerless to halt the fighting that erupted as the British withdrew their troops in 1948 . Modern Israel The State of Israel was declared during this difficult time . In response , member states of the Arab League sent troops to help the Palestinian Arabs . West Jerusalem , separated from the rest of the new Jewish nation , held out under siege for several months until Israeli forces secured a land corridor connecting the city to the coastal areas . Jews were evacuated from the Old City ' s Jewish Quarter , and thousands of Arab families fled their homes in West Jerusalem . As a result of armistice agreements in 1949 , Jerusalem was divided : West Jerusalem was to be under Israeli control , and East Jerusalem ( including the Old City , with its Jewish , Muslim , Christian , and Armenian quarters ) came under Jordanian authority . Free access to holy sites for members of all religions was guaranteed by the armistice agreements . However , with the city partitioned by fortifications and barbed wire , no Israeli or Jewish pilgrims were allowed to visit the Western Wall or other Jewish sites in East Jerusalem . For the next 19 years , Jerusalem was two cities . Political and religious boundaries were aggravated by occasional incidents of terrorism or sniping until the Six Day War in June 1967 . Within three days the city was completely in Israeli hands , and in two weeks it was physically and administratively reunited . Jerusalem ' s mayor , Teddy Kollek , spent the next 25 years orchestrating a vast program of development , adding new cultural institutions and parks and instituting neighborhood restoration projects while tirelessly me diating the concerns of Jerusalem ' s many communities . Today , as always , Jerusalem is a city of controversies : religious Jews in conflict with secular Jews ; Palestinians calling for independence ; many residents protesting a wave of high - rise development that many claim will turn the Holy City into a holy megalopolis . But the ideas and mystique that have always made this an extraordinarily special place rise above the ebbing and flowing concerns of present - day Jerusalem as it continues to tug at the world ' s attention into the new millennium .",
